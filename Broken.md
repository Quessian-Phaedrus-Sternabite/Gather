Your head lies in shattered pieces, each memory a stab to the brain. In front of you is a man, undefinable, any words you can think of sloughing off of your tongue as you forget who he his or who you are or why any of this is happening to you, right at this moment as you can't even remember walking into the building and- He snaps his fingers.
