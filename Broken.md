Your head lies in shattered pieces, each memory a stab to the brain. In front of you is a man, undefinable, any words you can think of sloughing off of your tongue as you forget who he his or who you are or why any of this is happening to you, right at this moment as you can't even remember walking into the building and- He snaps his fingers.
"Not another cretin... Snap out of it!" 
Your mind clears, still filled with that rotting haze, and even looking at the face directly causes another bout of dizziness that threatens to pour your mind out into a puddle on the pavement. Thoughts swim away as you force your head to turn away, flexing each muscle in concert to wrench the neck around until the old man no longer fills your field of vision. Finally, you can breathe again, parts of your chest you forgot existed choosing this moment to relax themselves, a trembling sigh emerging from your gaping maw whilst another disparaged one escaped from behind you.
"Let's begin."
Fighting the nausea flooding out of you proves too much, and you're unconscious while he drags your half-dead body away.

You wake up, in a room, with no concept of how much time has passed. Language fails you. You babble incoherently as a machine pumps your chest, breathing for you. Your eyes are pried open as a shapeless lump moves toward you. 
"Moron." 
The voice, distorted and yet clear as day, piercing into you and brings your awareness back into clarity. 
"Do you know why you're here?"
A babble sounds. It pains you to admit that it takes you a moment to realize the noise comes from your throat. You don't even consider the understanding that had returned, allowing you to process the voices.
"Figures. Your name doesn't matter, and neither does mine."
You had never even considered the fact you had a name. Your mind twists with the thought, before you realize you're nearly incapable of self-reflection, understanding the collective being of "you" as simply existing, with no thought maintaining. You do not think, and neither are you.
"All that you need to know is that this isn't new. You've been here before, have done what I asked, and this cycle will continue until the day you die, permanently, or become useless to me."
No context comes with his words, no solace to comfort you, but you still feel calmed. It feels like the pieces are sewing themselves back together, with a thread of purpose being weaved by his dismal words. The room's chill is getting to you, your skin cooling from the outside in, bone curling up in a sense as you try to huddle inside yourself. The man ignores you.
"You are going to go into Sooth carrying a large, untraceable explosive embedded into your DNA. Let me be clear. Not the genetic code of a bomb, but the entirety of your body being rewritten to have the functional structure of an explosive whilst barely maintaining coherency. Upon your death, you are to be retrieved by Me or another version of Myself and reassembled for another task."
The lack of memories could almost be said to result directly from the presence of this Old Man. Even shielded from any influence, even being separated by cloth and metal and anything else, just being in his presence makes your mind unweave itself.
