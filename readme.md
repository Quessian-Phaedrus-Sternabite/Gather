# Description

The Fall and Rise of Gather is a postmodern absurdist epic, told through stories, fables, and legends. The book is in reverse order, starting in a "dark age" and ending with the founding of the empire. It is primarily a sci-fi novel, with Gather starting out as a minor group and establishing itself as a dominant empire following a universal disaster. Due to the nature of the book, various things such as naming conventions[^1] change as the book progresses, becoming simpler. As such, it is intended to feel as if it speeds up as the book nears its end. To read this vault, I would advise starting with information, and then the various hubs to explore. Have fun!
