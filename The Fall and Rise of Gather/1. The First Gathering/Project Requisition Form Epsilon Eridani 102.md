### Project Requestion Form: Epsilon Eridani #102
#story , #novus, #one

My fellow council members. I, Umbra Novus, founding member of Gather, formally request project resources pertaining to the finance committee, overseen by Noelle Cathan, the legal committee, overseen by Charles Aevum, and the ethical committee, overseen by Amy Fidelis, to construct the first of Humanity's megastructures around the star Epsilon Eridani, a Dyson sphere to supply power to any Gather associated bodies. Support from Dr. Josiah Veritas is requested in the form of the power transference system, with the fleets of Cathan Goods being used for resource transport, extracted by mining teams overseen by myself. Additionally, a station, henceforth referred to as [Dyson Station 01](Capital%20Planets%204#%5E216e7e.md), would be constructed in orbit around the sphere to perform maintenance. The materials required are provided below.
1. The destruction of the outer asteroid belt of the system and Epsilon Eridani B for use as materials. Nuclear armaments may be employed.
2. Several trillion dollars for reimbursement of any workers involved.
3. Over 10 million tons of rare-earth metals from the Solar System for use in the project.
4. Approximately 500 able-bodied workers from any of the aforementioned companies to maintain the station.
I await the approval of this grant. More details are attached in the file below, specifying exact material amounts and technical specifications.
