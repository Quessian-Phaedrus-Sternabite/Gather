## Description
The beginning of Gather came about when the Founder recruited 7 of the world's most ambitious thinkers in an effort to bring about societal reform. After about 20 years of extraordinary success, the Founder was murdered by one of the group, leading to an immense conflict between the remaining 7.

## Writing Guide
When writing for the first gathering, it should generally be positive. Ideally, this is an organization of the greatest minds known to humanity. However, there should be a dark undertone throughout, showing how characters are stained by their ambitions.
