Mary had stormed into the Founder's chamber once, aiming a gun at him with a sneer on her face. She uttered words in the holy tongue, "all right ash-hole^[1], I'm tired of this bullshit.^[2]" The Founder had chuckled, and asked what was wrong. Mary continued to point a gun at his head^[3] and said she had gotten fed up with the Founder's lack of presence in maintaining Gather, and felt abused. It is well known that Fidelis had joined Gather to sabotage it, but became seduced by it's grand principals and ambitions, and as such, was constantly stirring up trouble. In this case, the Founder apologized, and asked what he could help with.

[1]: Ash-hole - A term of great reverence, for Mary Fidelis often calls the founder it in oral stories. Thought to be the flame that fuels the universe and exudes lifebringing ash.
[2]: In Old-Earth religions, bulls were sacred creatures, and their feces were used as fertilizer, and was known to locals as shit. This indicates Mary wanting to know the reasoning behind Gather freely giving away resources in a misguided bid for control.
[3]: In recovered sections from tapes, people of great power, such as emporers or presidents, were often kept in check with guns aimed at their heads as a reminder of them serving the people (see J(ames?) F. Kennedy)
