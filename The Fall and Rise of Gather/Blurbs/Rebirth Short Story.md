Memoir about someone slowing losing their five senses, ending with them going blind. Nobody notices this change, and his words seem to slide right off them. In the end, the main character is "reborn," and the story closes with them dumping their old self into the ocean. 

**Begin with the Main Character vomiting. Their proposal has failed. Set the stage for changing preferences.

The world slows. Nothing seems to change even as familiarity is lost. This is the first time they lose a sense. It starts with touch, with the world sliding off and becoming indistinct. People began to forget their face. They begin to forget their face. 

A few months pass. They’ve become a recluse. Their savings should be dwindling, but money keeps flowing in. They lose their hearing and sense of taste. The previous joys are now horrific, and they can feel themselves wince every time they take a bite of tasteless food. 

Nothing has changed. Society moves on. They’ve got a job. It’s slowly shown that the main character is now blind. Whereas before they were a prospector/foreman, they now work in an office doing menial labor. It’s unknown how old they are.

Finally, the main character emerges triumphant. They regain their sight, and are beloved by all. Whereas before, everything was stagnant, it now moves. Until you look inside their mind. They’re trapped. It’s a complete rebirth–a metamorphosis–and they’ve been left behind. As they feel their new self, their new face, go to the balcony where everything first change, they decide to jump into the sea before the story cuts off.**

I stared off the balcony and into the sea, where waves sent foam crashing into me. The salty smell cut through the air and assaulted my nostrils, settling in peacefully amongst the vomit. It wasn't enough to balance the sensations. As I emptied my stomach in time with the waves, I blithely let the salt of my tears drop to the sea as well. 

"Fish?" She had yelled. "Of all the things to suddenly hate, it's fish‽" Only a few minutes ago, we had been eating together at a little table by the harbor. I was planning on proposing. It should have been perfect. Our favorite meal, our favorite place, and with the sunset casting a rosy light across the scene; everything was set. But I couldn't force down the bile that wormed its way up my throat and out onto the pavement, onto her sneakers and capris. 

It just didn't make any sense. Why I suddenly couldn't stand the flakes of fish that sprouted into my mouth. Even as she tore into me, saying I had "changed" recently and had been distant, all I could focus on was the salmon. The taste just wouldn't leave me. It wasn't an allergy--at least as far as I could tell--I didn't feel any pain or burning. It was just a brutal discomfort that suffused my being and left me shaking with quease. 

...

I took another bite of my sandwich. Tuna, the closest thing to salmon I could bear. "So that's when it hit me, Mark." I spoke between bites, my words ever so slightly muffled. "I just couldn't stand the smell of her perfume. It's weird, isn't it?" Mark shrugged, focusing more on a kernel between his teeth than my plights. He finally sighed and stopped picking.

"Look, man, it probably just reminded you of your ex. Happens to me all the time." Mark stood up, brushed the dirt off of his pants, and turned to leave. "Oh yeah," he said, not looking at me, "and my name is Mike." 

I left the job site with few waves. Most everyone was listless, kicking stones or sitting on rubble with nothing to say. There was nothing to do, and you could feel it. Even the pay had stopped meaning anything with the constant delays and boredom brought on by bureaucracy. All that was left at the end of the day was a thin layer of dust coating each and every one of us.

The hotdog stand I frequented was gone. In its stead was a new one, with an unfamiliar man.

"What happened to the last guy?" I asked as I pulled out some change. I was a few cents away from being able to pay exactly, so I resigned myself to overpaying as a tip. Keep it round.

Jamie, as his nametag read, didn't even look as he grabbed a bun with his left and a sausage with his right in a practiced move that betrayed his experience. "Couldn't keep up." There was nothing else to be said. The dreary grey skies, the cracks in the concrete--everything suggested that life was slowing down. Jamie didn't even ask for a tip, and he only seemed mildly perturbed when I told him to keep the change. It was only after I left that I realized no prices were listed. 

My door unlocked smoothly, and I made for the couch. I had moved out as soon as the lease was up, and I was likely to renew this one when I got a chance. From the window, I could see the same wharf where, if I imagined hard enough, my vomit still sat dried in the cracks of the cobbles. The few was refreshing once the bittersweet left.

I sat on the couch and immediately cried out. The hotdog flung into the air, landing in a heap on the carpet, toppings scattered. It was instinct for me to flop down on my soft couch. So why had I slammed my head on the wooden back of a chair? As I rolled off, tenderly rubbing my head in pain, I saw only divots where the chair sat on the rug. Nothing to indicate a couch ever being there. Come to think of it--I couldn't even remember having a couch. Not in this apartment, not in the one with Anna, and especially not in my dorm. We never had room. I still didn't have room.

I swept the hotdog off the floor and threw it away before opening the fridge. My headache had spread to the rest of my body; I grabbed a bottled protein shake in spite of it. I still needed to work out, regardless of a fall. Besides, surely I was young enough to walk off a plummet. 

Sitting in the chair was second-nature, as it should be. I switched on the tv to C-Span and began scrolling as I drank my shake. Despite the noise--the clattering of news and the chirruping of my phone--it felt quiet. It only took a few minutes to finish my makeshift dinner, and I laid the bottle to the side in an idle motion. Part of me was ready to work out, but the exhaustion of the day and the pain was getting to me. The news switched to another story as I sat back and continued browsing.

An hour went by. My face flushed when I realized how much time I had wasted. Why hadn't I worked out yet? It should have been habit. I should already be in the shower, satisfied after a nice run, but instead I was still on the chair. It was too dark to run by myself at this point, and the night had grown cold. I sat back in my hard, wooden chair, and cried.

...

The doctors said it shouldn't be permanent. Nothing was wrong with me, of course, my brain had just decided to stop hearing. By the end of the day, they had to shout for me to hear the diagnosis. By the end of the week, it felt like my ears were filled with cotton. 

It wasn't the absence of noise, per se. Instead, it was the feeling of having a stuffed skull, where every sound is made dull and enormous by the seemingly endless reverb trapped in my brain. Speech fell away, the notes of others' voices smoothed out by my lack of hearing. Instead of words, all I could hear were pure tones, ringing out in the void. 

Nobody reached out to me. I shouldn't have been surprised. There was no reason why somebody should make the effort to connect with me when I hadn't in the past. After my hearing left, it was only worse, with communique having to be scrawled out to reach me. Sign language provided little relief, as ASL was all that was offered. To have my own language stripped away from me as I was forced to confer through stilted English was the second death I felt with my lack of hearing.

I didn't know how I would continue. I almost didn't want to. But the speech therapist was covered by my insurance, and the bureaucrats above me loved the idea of having representation among the crew. Our older project was finished--a shining bakery cum apartments cum who knows what else--and we were left furloughed with nothing to do. I don't know how any of those apartments sold. The entire thing felt like death.

When the news of my furlough arrived, I met it with a resigned sort of anger. It wasn't my fault that I had been stripped of my humanity, but here I was being made to suffer for it. I could apply and apply all I wanted, but the second it came time to interview, I was left stumbling over my hands as my fingers refused to work. Cold filled my heart whenever I moved them, and I kept wishing to cut them off, to replace my hands with ears so I could hear again.

I suppose I got my wish.

...

*Have you found a job yet?* I couldn't see her face, but the movement of the hands told me exactly who was signing to me. I shrugged my hands, dismissing her even as she circled around towards my front. We both knew the answer. I couldn't remember her name, but she had moved into the flat next door. She seemed to take an interest in me, learning sign language to be closer. Whatever she was called probably started with an A, but the rest was so garbled through fluidity as to be indecipherable. 

I stood up and starting trudging away, opening my phone as I did so. My bank account was full, another deposit from my worker's comp having come in. The funny thing about the situation was that I hadn't even applied for compensation. The company must have done so--the last saving grace of a corrupted HR department. I didn't even have the fulfillment of earning my own money.
