Memoir about someone slowing losing their five senses, ending with them going blind. Nobody notices this change, and his words seem to slide right off them. In the end, the main character is "reborn," and the story closes with them dumping their old self into the ocean. 


I stared off the balcony and into the sea, where waves sent foam crashing into me. The salty smell cut through the air and assaulted my nostrils, settling in peacefully amongst the vomit. It wasn't enough to balance the sensations. As I emptied my stomach in time with the waves, I blithely let the salt of my tears drop to the sea as well. 

"Fish?" She had yelled. "Of all the things to suddenly hate, it's fishâ€½" Only a few minutes ago, we had been eating together at a little table by the harbor. I was planning on proposing. It should have been perfect. Our favorite meal, our favorite place, and with the sunset casting a rosy light across the scene; everything was set. But I couldn't force down the bile that wormed its way up my throat and out onto the pavement, onto her sneakers and capris. 

It just didn't make any sense. Why I suddenly couldn't stand the flakes of fish that sprouted into my mouth. Even as she tore into me, saying I had "changed" recently and had been distant, all I could focus on was the salmon. The taste just wouldn't leave me. It wasn't an allergy--at least as far as I could tell--I didn't feel any pain or burning. It was just a brutal discomfort that suffused my being and left me shaking with quease. 

...

I took another bite of my sandwich. Tuna, the closest thing to salmon I could bear. "So that's when it hit me, Mark." I spoke between bites, my words ever so slightly muffled. "I just couldn't stand the smell of her perfume. It's weird, isn't it?" Mark shrugged, focusing more on a kernel between his teeth than my plights. He finally sighed and stopped picking.

"Look, man, it probably just reminded you of your ex. Happens to me all the time." Mark stood up, brushed the dirt off of his pants, and turned to leave. "Oh yeah," he said, not looking at me, "and my name is Mike." 

I left the job site with few waves. Most everyone was listless, kicking stones or sitting on rubble with nothing to say. There was nothing to do, and you could feel it. Even the pay had stopped meaning anything with the constant delays and boredom brought on by bureaucracy. All that was left at the end of the day was a thin layer of dust coating each and every one of us.

The hotdog stand I frequented was gone. In its stead was a new one, with an unfamiliar man.

"What happened to the last guy?" I asked as I pulled out some change. I was a few cents away from being able to pay exactly, so I resigned myself to overpaying as a tip. Keep it round.

Jamie, as his nametag read, didn't even look as he grabbed a bun with his left and a sausage with his right in a practiced move that betrayed his experience. "Couldn't keep up." There was nothing else to be said. The dreary grey skies, the cracks in the concrete--everything suggested that life was slowing down. Jamie didn't even ask for a tip, and he only seemed mildly perturbed when I told him to keep the change. It was only after I left that I realized no prices were listed. 

My door unlocked smoothly, and I made for the couch. I had moved out as soon as the lease was up, and I was likely to renew this one when I got a chance. From the window, I could see the same wharf where, if I imagined hard enough, my vomit still sat dried in the cracks of the cobbles. The few was refreshing once the bittersweet left.

I sat on the couch and immediately cried out. The hotdog flung into the air, landing in a heap on the carpet, toppings scattered. It was instinct for me to flop down on my soft couch. So why had I slammed my head on the wooden back of a chair? As I rolled off, tenderly rubbing my head in pain, I saw only divots where the chair sat on the rug. Nothing to indicate a couch ever being there. Come to think of it--I couldn't even remember having a couch. Not in this apartment, not in the one with Anna, and especially not in my dorm. We never had room. I still didn't have room.

I swept the hotdog off the floor and threw it away before opening the fridge. My headache had spread to the rest of my body; I grabbed a bottled protein shake in spite of it. I still needed to work out, regardless of a fall. Besides, surely I was young enough to walk off a plummet. 

Sitting in the chair was second-nature, as it should be. I switched on the tv to C-Span and began scrolling as I drank my shake. Despite the noise--the clattering of news and the chirruping of my phone--it felt quiet. It only took a few minutes to finish my makeshift dinner, and I laid the bottle to the side in an idle motion. Part of me was ready to work out, but the exhaustion of the day and the pain was getting to me. The news switched to another story as I sat back and continued browsing.

An hour went by. My face flushed when I realized how much time I had wasted. Why hadn't I worked out yet? It should have been habit. I should already be in the shower, satisfied after a nice run, but instead I was still on the chair. It was too dark to run by myself at this point, and the
