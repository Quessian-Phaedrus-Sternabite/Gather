She sat on the edge of two worlds. Behind her, the dappled surface of her unnamed moon glimmered spectacularly in the light of Periwinkle Dark, the terribly named 120 billionth or so star observed by Gather.  Dark 4 was below her, or above, depending on your frame of reference, and her head went clear as a sigh leaked from her visor. 

It was quiet. 

The only noises present came from a periodic hiss of air as she wasted breath, each sigh a melancholic drizzle of precious gas into the rushing tide of vacuum. And yet, she drifted along and relaxed in the water. Another content and yet so deeply morose sigh lauds itself upon her face and the moon's. Dark 4 was, as expected, pitch black from her vantage point at this time of night. Light hadn't graced its surface in artificial amounts to any measurable extent, and the very fact brought solace. She really needed to stop sighing. 

A pelt into her arm changed her mind. 

Normally, it's recommended to close yourself off, protect your sanctuary of life that defines your internal biome from the harshness of space. How can the absence of, well, *everything* present as any describable feeling? The answer, of course, is that it isn't. Describable, that is. And yet, the jam of nothing is softer than silk, glancing across her skin in its lovely hallucinated winds, the nerves stitching together signals into a quilt of energy and relaxation. It was, perhaps the universe's harshest massage. 

She sighed as the pain abated from the impact of a micrometeorite, nothing important, really, but enough to get her to stop focusing on the planet occupying a good 40 degrees of her field of vision. Being exposed had its detractions--there's a reason why exposure was such a huge cause of death. Her skin burns with cosmic radiation, lifetimes' worth of a death sentence to the unfortified. Which, to someone wearing nothing but a breathing mask connected to a respirator being used as a cushion, is not wisely recommended. Periwinkle wasn't terrible bright, but it was enough to raise the surrounding temperatures to something that would emulsify any alma. *Almost* any Alma. So as she sat there, basking in the setting eclipse, one of the few people to ever exposed to the barren void of space for such lengths of time without protection. 

She had even practiced for this. At any moment, she could relinquish her mask and tank and subsist for close to a day without terribly ill effects. So it wasn't that terrible a risk to endure.

She was at peace. 

It was, without a doubt, one of the most glorious works of art she had ever seen, that of existence, that of an eclipse cutting off what would be misery to the unkempt, that of inevitable contrast between a galaxy filled with crumbling structure and a landscape painted in the certainty of chaos, a landscape of warmth and solitude even as it threatens to strip away the protections of flesh and of mind, allowing for complete freedom with all the threats that entails. Dark 4 was yet to be developed, and this was merely its third or fourth survey. The first was to establish a minor space station; a dyson swarm came along with the second and opened the system up to colonization. Somewhere between then and the here and now, some group of people had come to live on the lush and habitable surface.
