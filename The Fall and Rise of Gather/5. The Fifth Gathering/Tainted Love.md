%% A Painful love story. The main character, Kaia, is part of a psuedo-commune on the outskirts. They are abandoned, with no family name or cr√®che. The group have grown up in the arid wastes, with only a few adults. They subside off of selling crops, primarily paper and oriented strand board that's made from a gnarled, thorny woody bush. As such, the only thing the community has a large amount of is housing, creating dense sprawls of loosely maintained wooden shacks. This has been going for at least five generations. The story begins with Kaia being afraid of one of the men in the community, Lennox, who's around her age (22) and has been torturing and abusing her. Around this time, she ends up alone with him during a tax-collection raid on the shantytown. He proceeded to finally cause he to snap by pushing her arm into a machine resembling a woodchipper and having her manually deglove herself. The torture causes her resentment to fester into hatred against the psychopath, and she lashes out, taking the next time he goes to push her as provocation to beat him, not stopping once he's on the ground. Finally, to get revenge, she irreversibly maims his right arm, rendering him as an invalid. Lennox swears she isn't safe, and escapes into the stacks. A few days later, she's attacked in her sleep by a few of the other men in the community, and is in the process of being beaten before one of the other men her age, Hamish, comes to her rescue. He stabs one of the men, and runs away with Kaia, where the two of them fall asleep next to each other on one of the roofs. Thus begins a steady relationship, with Hamish protecting Kaia and ensuring she stays safe. This continues until the two of them are sparring and she's knocked down brutally. Hamish proceeds to reveal his true colors as a sociopath who's been using Kaia solely as a means to grow his reputation as a fighter and a lover, one that he means to use to go into politics after "accidentally" killing Kaia during sparring. He proceeds to stab her with a spear, pressing through her stomach and into the ground. At this point, Kaia blacks out, and witnesses Lennox and Hamish both living successful lives in between fits of delusion. When she comes to, she finds herself in a hospital, missing everything below the torso and the majority of her right arm. She's informed that someone had set her "corpse" on fire, causing irreversible damage to the arm and everything below the torso; Kaia is only alive because of rain that came through and left the wounds cauterized but beyond saving. Her life is broken, she's astronomically far from home, and she will never walk again. After being crushed by the str
