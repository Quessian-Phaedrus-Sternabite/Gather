%% A Painful love story. The main character, Kaia, is part of a psuedo-commune on the outskirts. They are abandoned, with no family name or cr√®che. The group have grown up in the arid wastes, with only a few adults. They subside off of selling crops, primarily paper and oriented strand board that's made from a gnarled, thorny woody bush.
