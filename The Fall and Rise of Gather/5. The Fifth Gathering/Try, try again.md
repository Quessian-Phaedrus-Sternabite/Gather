It was a short fall through the barren void of space, decrepit and desolate, isolating and cold, frozen and radiant, burning with effervescent light, hurtling with infinite movement, tranquility without meaning, causation without citations of meaning or relevance, turning through the vacuum in a thrall of momentum, pulling bodies into its warm embrace, sucking at the pitted surfaces of the crafts, sailing upon winds of stars, peaceful and violent: chaos in motion. Eryn 7, a station constructed in the heart of a moon- hollowed out for purposes beyond comprehension- flung herself through the night sky towards Forwards, a planet of moderate renown, marked only by the ever-present magnetic field that burns the very atmosphere of the planet. Thrash, a magnetar first discovered in the second Gathering's rapid expansion, provides harsh fields that  destroy both the prospects of technology and colonization of Forwards and generates bounties of magnets; glorious things with Curie temperatures higher than anything else extractable en masse, capable of generating immense forces, and exceedingly crucial to the stability of Gather: the Hollow Empire herself. Texts, recordings, and memories from the Fourth Gathering lend credence to ideas of magnets capable of moving entire planets with masses of only a gram, or densities impossibly high, things embodying the idea of attraction themselves they're so potent in the tales. And tales they are, as any of these miraculous materials are all but lost to the ravages of time, space, and trade: broken apart into smaller pieces, more crucial, more vulnerable, until the very dust that holds together Dyson spheres becomes remembered with a fade, as a fad upon the universe, a collective hallucination of technology irreparable by "modern" engineering. These magnets are gone. They will *never* return. But more must come, maintenance must be maintained, society must continue pushing forward; power will be served. So it comes as no surprise that Cathan Goods holds a stronghold on Forwards, absolved with the self-serving benefaction of good- feelings, emotions, and publicity in their entirety- that allows them to make absurd profits (⸮for isn't that the name of the game? the dust is blown away, the cracks are spreading, and a paste, a slapdash effort for a network of trillions to sustain an empire, is poured) on selling these magnets. Selling, transporting, it's all the same; magnets, like money or water, flow at the pace of honey. Everyone needs them, wants them, will get them: it's only a matter of how. Things happen, whether approved or not, and will continue to happen unless stopped, which is liable to never happen, despite happenings. 

Thrash thrashes Forwards, beats it mercilessly, and as such, destroys any foothold Cathan has on the mild planet. Their technology they so rely on fails, every loss signaling more than inconvenience; it forces a loss of wealth and power necessary, if not itself the point, of controlling Forwards. The planet rejects them, spits in the face of their subjugation, and as such, requires care in approach. Every contact by Eryn 7 is limited, as she can only contact Forwards through specialized equipment in their Helmholtz coils, beasts of metal engrossed in metal, projecting a desperate barrier that electromagnetic fields, including radio, microwave, or gamma rays can hardly pierce, active by nature but passive in their connotation; this contact comes only when the orbits intersect ever so slightly, bringing with it shipments, any food that can't be grown, shielded technology, materials, tools, clothing, textiles, and most importantly: clones. The lifebringing clones that enable colonization, enable labor, enable the extraction of magnets and the production of the greatest resource known to the Fifth Gathering, or at least one of the dozens; the clones themselves are the most potent of tools: they think only enough to live, are expendable, and they follow orders out of some sort of demented self-preservation. The higher a clone's number, the less respect they command; a system manufactured by the wardens of their narcissistic prisons to keep everyone in line. Control, after all, is the only thing more valuable than currency, despite them being one and the same.

On the surface, a spider crawls across the landscape. Not of flesh, chitin, or anything else a biological spider may have; this one is partially biological but purely mechanical, containing a micro-ecosystem of life: humans, guma, and even olea "thrive" atop this spider of wood. For wood works- metal, motors, anything remotely ferrous would be sucked up, thrown around, or rendered useless by the magnetic fields, rocks, and even dust in the air- wood was all but necessary. Olea were made fun of, of course, for being right at home in the immense forests of Forwards, living within the butchered corpses of lives gone longer than anyone in the Fifth Gathering (born then, that is), crawling across the landscape to a new sight seemingly daily, weekly, monthly: it didn't matter. What did matter was the mining, brutally manual, with laborious hours spent toiling away at rocks in hope to find those precious magnets and sustain Gather for just a bit longer. The Spider, as it was "lovingly" called by its inhabitants, was a hulking thing, constructed entirely of woods and plastics and anything else that could be scraped together in some odd construction immune to the dangers of Thrash. The clones often died performing the hard work, especially without the safety equipment and tools to assist them. Towering above all else, at 70 meters tall, the Spider was a city among itself, an Escherian nightmare ironclad in veneer, its passageways turning and twisting in an almost organic shape. The miners, of course, stored any and all gear there, in whatever nook or cranny wasn't filled with fibrous or even normal growths; such as were common atop the Spider. It seemed to stretch from end to end several kilometers, and it was an unspoken pact that no one should be allowed to know it to the full extent. Every second, every night failing that, the clones' brains were ported to a server, a database of biological wetware seeming to grow through the Spider, the only thing that could contain data in the presence of such a field. Such was Cathan's nature, their specialty since the very beginning, and so the clones were limiting to backing up while on the crawl. Any perishing was met with forwarding to the necessary parties aboard Eryn and subsequent restoral to the rightful place of mining that the clones belonged to. Questions of deserving were levied often, but relentlessly answered by wardens provided naught an opportunity of escape. What started as debt and ended in death- whether by the Company, in service to the Company, or through chance- the indenture of the slaves (for that's what they were), started at death and lasted until either someone went through a long enough time, paid off their debt (unlikely), or went through enough iterations, whichever came last- failing the second. It was with this that Spider became populated, thousands of minds stored in eternal limbo; a cycle of resurrection and rebirth being thrown into their faces, every death an increase in owing as an rule of nature (sparked upon naturally by the incredible cost of making a clone [still less than the magnets sold for]), every day forced to work until they couldn't anymore, every life snuffed out replaced by one fresh and ready to go. And the memories carried over. Some clones tried to escape (to no avail, as it was nearly impossible), while others were merely petrified with the eternal life presented in the timespan they signed away. The thought was depressing. 

Above it all lay Eryn, with an orbit intersecting Forwards 4 times each stund, providing numerous windows of opportunity for transfer; the less fuel required, the better. Forward would sweep through the stars, starting at a distance far enough away from Thrash to be able to communicate, receive supplies, and send off shipments, draw near enough to Thrash to necessitate DNA storage of data within reinforced chambers and a prolonged hibernation of all employee's to ensure no lasting damage, ending again at a lonely pinprick distant from Thrash and Forwards combined. On these intersects, if it was needed (which it always was), Clones would be shot down to the planet, supplies would be hurled up, and homeostasis would continue. Trillions were made this way, the money flowing into Cathan Goods and the magnets flowing out, a paradigm of perfect profits and persnickety processing; all was well. Except for the clones, that is. 

Within the Spider were untold bunks, assigned to no one and everyone simultaneously, each outfitted with a long, spindly needle to hijack the brain's contents and record everything: memories, experiences, useful resources, upon which anything not useful to the company was discarded (storage was limited, consciousness is cheap, and besides: the brain is resilient) and the knowledge of an indent, for that was what they were called- they relished in their servitude, and those who didn't despaired silently- was preserved for quick replication. Drift occurred, as was expected when a large portion of what makes a person themselves is stripped away for efficiency's sake, and personalities suffered. For many, this was fine. One of those "unnecessary" qualities happened to be resentment, or just strong emotions in general, and so most couldn't care about the horrors they endured, the long hours, the possible destruction of their biologies providing nary a doubt in their minds as they continued their forced slavery. For most, it started with debt. A simple thing, really, in an age where surplus expired and currencies became mandate- iron laws to bind people together like the connections of old. Debt was a natural response, an adaptation of the system to ensure power could be maintained, purchases could be carried out, and Gather could carry on in Empire. Each Crèche dealt with debt differently, ranging from community service to temporary shame to, as seen in Cathan, internment. This, of course, lay behind the veil of governmental and corporate monotony as a last resort, only the most dire consequences to the most dire of people. Upon entering into a contract with a Cathan lender, your identity was signed over to them as collateral, allowing unlimited borrowing with no repercussions; this stayed the case until death. After some edicts by the Aevum Courts, the cloning of a person before death, or even just after death without consent (as provided by Cathan's predatory contracts) was strictly prohibited- punishable by death and erasure from any of the Seven's databases. So Cathan waited, silently hoping for the deaths of their customers until they could redeem their collateral and force suffering, deletion of personality even, upon the listless masses that couldn't help but borrow. Arguments were made for ethics, but ignored by Cathan, who claimed that their clones were but partial copies of the originals, and ⸮besides, upon release, couldn't they just have the memories removed? So they kept shoveling people into the gullet of Forwards and the Spider, and all was well. 

Cathan Rowan 89 had once had a family, but it had all blurred away. The years had been tough, the labor difficult, and the Spider taking a toll with every death until nearly everything- personality, hopes, dreams, family, philosophies, and even identity was stripped away. Nothing remained but the ingrained patterns of mining and extraction. They were a good worker, all things considered, and had a relatively low number, indicating either youth or cleverness. For Rowan, the former was the case, with only 300 or so years wasted upon Forwards, and only a few dozen corpses left to provide nourishment towards the soils of the forsaken planet. No friends were present, for they were superfluous, talking would lead to death or reduced efficiency; some people were known to disappear and be replaced with a tuned-up copy of themselves with greater drive, a gradual process of learning that whittled someone down into the perfect machine, a slave designed to perform their job exactly to specifications and yet adapt to any malfunctions, disjunctions in the process. Rowan wasn't yet like that. Some scintilla of personality remained, clutching on to the thought of freedom, early, late, or on time- it didn't matter. Escape was nearly impossible from Forwards, as those that dwelled were constantly told, with the only way off planet being constantly protected. Space elevators were too impractical; to create an elevator using entirely non-magnetic materials was considered an impossibility, worth far too much effort, even for a planet as important as Forwards; railgun based methods were likewise ruled out, as any rails could be flung into the atmosphere at a moment's notice. But tethers worked. A brilliant combination of momentum exchange and an electrodynamic tether allowed for a shockingly stable system that could elevate cargo into low orbit while costing extremely small amounts. The cable would swing as a pendulum, seeming to come to a stop at the point of contact before accelerating back up to incredible velocities. For Rowan, it was a pipe dream, and one that faded further with every iteration and only occasionally resurged. Of course, occasion was the ruler of eternity. 

The tethers dangled down tantalizing in front of the Spider's grasp, worming around the atmosphere before hurling themselves into space, an elliptical orbit stretching towards an intercept, or barring that, a Lagrange point, where the payload could wait until syzygy of Thrash, Eryn, and Forwards occurred. Some rumored towards the Spider having a mind of its own, a conscious formed of the souls of iterations thrown away, memories coalescing in a strange combination of hopes and dreams, impractical in its command but glorious in its empathy, watching over the clones as they slept and protecting its mechanical-biological fusion (that the Cathan were so well-known for) from any of the harshness of Forwards, a true ghost in the shell of a dysarthric body, the hollowed husks and plants and brains combining to make something bigger than its parts. Rumor had it that Cathan Goods had lost control of the Spider- that they had to ask it where to go and beg it to respond, or that they were merely pawns to its fledgling mind and it told them what to do, or that it was a clone itself, a consciousness thrown into a machine to let it grow naturally, something completely against the rules and laws of Gather but done anyways because ⸮who cares about the laws? The vile corruption of Gather had spread, worming its way through the roots of society and tearing apart the Crèches with their gilded legacy from the golden age, forcing them into schisms of despair, longing, apathy, and ensuring the slow and inevitable downfall of society. But still, money flowed. Rowan was no stranger to this, especially not after an absurd amount of debt (roughly 1.2 billion dinar) translated directly to 1200 years spent mining, doing nothing but digging and mining and smelting or refining the magnets until they could be shipped off in lead-lined crates to be sold to others who would go in debt and the cycle continues, never stopping, always repeating, an infinite web of tangled lending and borrowing that sucks whoever it can down into it, anything to provide fuel to that machine, to the Spider, to Forwards. Forwards, of course, isn't the only facility, rather it's a small one on the outskirts of civilized space, its harshness meaning only the worst of the worst get sent there. Rowan didn't consider themselves to be the worst of the worst; if anything, they were merely over their head. The Spider didn't care. If one were to track its movements over time, they might notice a distinct web-like pattern in 3-dimensions, encircling the planet in a tangled graph of lodes and nodes of magnets and minerals. Parts of the terrain were torn asunder by the magnets, with pulses from Thrash ripping the ground itself apart- these were the most profitable (and, of course, treacherous) deposits, places with impossible ledges teetering on the bring of collapse and open-air veins ripe for the harvest. More support for the Spider's consciousness came in the form of its uncanny sense for finding the precious metal- though it was easily remedied by the existence of satellites and radar and any manner of sensing technologies employed by Cathan to map out the planet. There needed to be a way to make sure it was worth mining, after all. 

***

Rowan 90 had woken up one day realizing the last was an empty hole in their memory- a reset had occurred. It was bound to happen to everyone eventually, but that didn't stop it from being jarring. One of the faults had opened up, and the Spider had moved in to harvest it, with all the iterations being made to help. It was a simple leap to assume that they had fallen off a cliff, and a simpler one to realize that meant an extension of time spent laboring. Everything cost- the air, food, water, and most importantly: the clones, as even one could cost millions to grow quickly enough. Stifled groans slipped out of Rowan's mouth before they got up and moved to grab equipment. Through some miracle of chance, the atmosphere was breathable on Forwards, unlike some of the other colonies Cathan employed for resource extraction. As such, protection was less critical, and preparing was more cumbersome. Rowan was accustomed to procedure at this point, but a niggling presence ran up their spine as they began grabbing the equipment needed for the mines. *Escape.* It had been quite some time since thoughts of escape had crossed their mind, and it came as no small shock. Everyone knew escape was impossible- to try all but guaranteed death, and more debt, and more time spent suffering- it would be foolish to attempt and even foolish assuming success; Cathan still had the memory backups, and no person in the public record would dare clone a fugitive servant, lest a copy is created- because that was rumored, a person escaping and Cathan merely cloning them again but tweaked, with the hopes of escape long removed and mercenaries tracking down the lost clone- it is nothing but a death sentence to try and leave; more importantly, it is a death of the stream of consciousness, an entire branch of personality lost to erasure. And yet, Rowan could hardly resist. The taste of freedom had eluded them for well over a century at this point, the exact days or years breaking down, and the suffering of eternal limbo was taking its toll. Scarcity was deliberate, the supply of magnets being controlled by the speed of production, and it was well-known (to those in the know) that Cathan Goods could send in enough clones to drain the planet dry in a matter of decades if they so wished, but it was more profitable to hang the threat of indenture over their lenders and to keep society dependent on them. 1200 years was but a blink of the eye in that case, and the planet would still be bursting at the seams, waiting for whoever approached with boundless ambition to claim its treasure. Rowan was nothing in the face of this machine called empire. But still, one could not help but dream. And dreams are liable to blend into reality, their facets shaping the nature of the world in ways limited only by the ambition of the user, and for Rowan 90, ambition had struck back in a dreadful resurgence. So it was as such that Rowan began organizing resistance, revolution against Cathan; it started as nothing more than deliberate unproductivity, but it quickly escalated into the realm of skirmishes, fights conducted from the heart of Spider in the spaces where space abounded- Cathan almost couldn't keep up. Almost. With every resisted movement, it was assured that they would fight back, with reinforcements already being prepared aboard her desolate majesty Eryn 7, and the clones knew that revolution must come quick. So when Rowan 90 was shot through the eye, it came as no surprise when the revolution collapsed.

***

Rowan 91 jolted awake. Thoughts of revolution flitted through their mind, and Rowan almost gagged at the stupidity of their younger self. To attempt revolution on Forwards? Laughable. So it was that Rowan 91 continued the grand work of excavating Forwards beneath the belly of the Spider. The days stretched onwards, each another exercise in tedium as the Spider traversed across the landscape. All of the clones had resumed normal duties, with any dissenter having been purged and reevaluated to ensure maximum productivity- this was extraordinarily effective, after all, if you can directly modify people's memories and personalities, it's merely trial and error until you can strip them of everything that makes them unique. Within the Spider's thousands of rooms lay grand halls, for meetings, dining, sleeping, all of the works. Rowan 91 was aware of this, dimly, and exuded a grand apathy for the luxuries employed by some of the higher-ups, the staff who willingly worked there or the wardens sent to keep the prisoner's in line; it might not have been the most exotic goods or the finest amenities, but it was enough to force many of the clones into jealousy, and yes, revolt, as they strived for some modicum of pleasure. Rowan 91 didn't care. The underside of Spider was covered in tunnels, porous things that stretched across the kilometers and seemed to creep through the bowels of the glorious mechanical beast and turn upwards through the heart of Spider before weaving back down and passing through dormitories and the halls and all the more as the tunnels broke apart and split into dozens more until a whole network, a patchwork cloth of secrecy enclosed all of Spider in its loving embrace. The tunnels were warm- all of Spider was; temperature-controlled, that is- and cots would surface regularly, as well as lavatories, all the things needed for survival conveniently strewn about for anyone to indulge in. It was as such that with the living areas alone being the size of a large city that the clones were tracked, subdermal chips imbedded into their arms, legs, and chest, anything to ensure they couldn't carve it out, and every cot with a memory backup (that disuse of would be tantamount to death) being connected to that central brain of Spider that managed such things, leading of course to the utter lack of secrecy within Spider, unless you managed to convince it not to track you, or gouge out every chip with silverware from the lunchrooms, or do any of the things the clones had discovered over the centuries to hide themselves. Again, Rowan 91 did not care. They went about the daily work with a chilling apathy, one noticed and written off by the other clones as a product of the restructuring- liable to be stronger or altogether gone in the next iteration- and let Rowan do their work in silence. 

Every day was the same. It began with emergence from those cots, some cocoons, other mattresses, all designed to be easy to leave and hard to breach. Following that, equipment was collected; miners geared up with that pitiful chatter that happens amongst anyone from a worker being paid the absolute minimum to dignitaries making small talk while discussions carry on. Safety was ignored, for the most part, clones were cheap, but could be charged as so much more, and so any way that the miners could die was a way Cathan Goods could profit. After suiting up, the indents would leave Spider and go to whatever site would chosen- once a quarter or so, a new site would be picked, and after travel, the clones would have to use explosives to carefully open up a fissure, sometimes kilometers deep; these cracks upon the face of Forwards would stretch onwards and provide ample opportunities for clones to sweep through the caves and squeeze themselves into gaps tighter than could be reasonably expected (many died in the first week as a result) to try and find a vein large enough for worthwhile extraction. Biological detectors, made with the technology of any of the species who were immersed in the Great Empire of Gather, were often employed, as they could work even in the harsh conditions present. Once a vein was found, they got to work. Fracking was employed, with pressure being generated from waterfalls, rivers, anything that could possibly work without electricity, anything to let Cathan get its hands on the precious minerals easily and cheaply, at least cheap to them. Rowan 91 was more knowledgeable than some of the other clones in this regards, on account of their long industrial history, and as such, would usually be put in charge of managing a small group, overseen by staff, of course, but the small inkling of power was enough to sustain them. On this day, some 330 years after first being interned, that was what Rowan was doing when an earthquake caused a trembling that threw Rowan and crew into the fissure.

When Rowan 91 awoke, all was dark, and they realized: something was wrong. Normally, a fall like that would be instant death. At least it would be assumed as such. All the other clones surrounding them were dead, and it would be clear to anyone above that no one could have survived. But whatever the means- a lucky airbag, corpses cushioning the fall, a controlled tumble- Rowan had survived. For starters, this meant an incongruity had formed, with a clone doubtlessly being formed on Eryn as they dwelled, loaded with Rowan's memories up to the day of death, this day, the day that led to Rowan currently being alive and stranded at the bottom of a 5-kilometer deep pit in the ground filled with too little magnetic ore to be a concern to Cathan. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem- after all, it was standard procedure; but for Rowan, this became pressing, urgent over the stifling heat of the pit and the choking darkness that threatened to engulf the clones in their entirety; any additional clone would lead to a divergence, memories splitting apart until two distinct Rowans emerged, illegal and immoral, liable to termination by Cathan to cover their asses, to ensure they wouldn't suffer for wrongly cloning someone before death. Rowan 92 would be safe, another perfect servant content to live out their next 900 years give or take in captivity, but Rowan 91 would be slain, marked as "obsolete" and disposed of in the composters of Spider. Escape was their only chance at survival now, for who wouldn't want to live? That same sense of self-preservation that had guided Rowan and all the other guma to grow and evolve in Andromeda now sent Rowan into a panicked spiral that threatened to collapse their heart or lungs in an instant with panic. Stealing themselves, Rowan began walking, trying to find any uphill slope at all. It took only a few minutes to realize they had no supplies, forcing a return to the site and a... "disassembly" of some of the other clones to use their meat and nutrients and sustenance during the difficult trek, stored in a cool bag salvaged from the site. With any luck, Rowan would be able to escape far from Spider and sneak aboard a tether, but it would be difficult. Time ticked onwards as they began trekking. 

After an hour, Rowan finally found a slope upwards, curving ever sharper in an exponential sort of way until it stopped at a 28-degree angle, too steep to walk but not sharp enough to be difficult to climb, and the craggy walls provided numerous handholds for Rowan to ascend. It took but a moment to strap the gear and ~400 kilograms of food onto their back and begin climbing; by their estimates, the slope went up for one to two hundred meters, a great starting amount. After the first 30 meters, Rowan needed a break, the toll of climbing with such a heavy load and near-complete darkness (phosphorescent lichen and plants provided mediocre light) was draining after a while. Finding a small ledge was simple, setting up rest with a cot made from the clothes of the other clones was a bit more difficult. A fire could be started with some of the minerals and austenitic steel- the non-magnetic metal being used for pickaxes- being used as a suitable flint and iron substitute. As Rowan 91 sat there, underneath a pitch black roof of stone, their mind began to work in overdrive; every limb in their body was aching with a pain that came from labor and from the climb and carrying 4 corpses on their back through a cave in the dark- all of it piled up from the long hours and Rowan just… wanted to rest. It took every ounce of willpower and drive contained within their body in order to continue on, but continue they did. Within about 10 minutes, the fire was neatly extinguished, before they left with the bag and the fuel- canisters of oil reserved for maintenance (after all, even wood can grind up against itself, and bone and clay one in the same)- stowed safely within the pack. The stitches were rudimentary, and the bag was practically held together with the extinguished hopes and dreams that pushed Rowan forwards, but it would have to be enough. The hours of the climb stretched on, until finally, after the relentless strain and stress, the muscles filling with acid and being purged moments later, regurgitated as bile that exuded itself as sweat through the young (clone, that is) guma’s pores, Rowan collapsed to the ground at the crest of the hill and laid down on their back. 

Trudging forwarded through the dusky murmuring of darkness that made up the cavern, Rowan lost track of time. Hours turned to days turned to 3 or 5 or 8, it didn’t matter, whatever the exact time was, it had been an eternity since Rowan was on the surface, and that wasn’t exactly an environment conducive to positive thinking. Still, Rowan shrugged on, forcing themselves to lift a leg than another and a foot up the inclines and slopes that formed the harsh crag, every step an endeavor and every meter hard fought. By now, surely, they would be presumed dead, and a clone would be growing. It wouldn’t be ready for another month, and Rowan would still be stuck down there. From their progress, the 4 and some kilometers was an insurmountable obstacle, representing months of work; the monotony had resumed- light, as well as fuel, was limited, with the only use of fire being to cook up hacked off limbs from the corpses of the former clones, bodies reduced to the nutrient sludge they came from, lean muscle hanging off their 3 and some meter frames on easily harvestable morsels. The weight was unbearable, but lightening- the guilt was the same; at first, it tore at Rowan, as old preconceptions were destroyed one bite at a time- it didn’t matter that the clones weren’t people anymore- it didn’t matter that the originals lay dead somewhere and these were facsimiles- it didn’t matter than Spider normally recycled the bodies in a more indirect form of this interspecial cannibalism- it didn’t matter that they would be alive and well and moving again by the time Rowan escaped this nightmarish pit and the nightmarish colony and just all of this nonsense. None of it could assuage the sheer guilt riddling the mind of Rowan. 91 iterations and still uncomfortable with the idea of death. What a pathetic failure. But Rowan pushed down those thoughts, simply overcame them, staying positive in the dark, whispering stories to themselves when the climb became difficult, regaining that lost personality that had been stripped by the great minds of Cathan. Rowan didn’t bow in the face of defeat, no, they laughed at it. Each step, previously so laborious, became triumphant, proof that Rowan had overcome adversity. With each success brought a promise of future success, each failure merely a stepping stone to a bright future- their heart soared with thoughts of inevitable freedom, their mind was overcome with emotion when confronted with escape. 

A full month passed by, and the faint trembling in the cavern had slowed. Far above, the wooden augers would be winding down, the metals being hauled out, the dig sites decided upon being fully excavated in preparation for moving away- still a couple of months out, but exploration at least could calm down. For Rowan, this was brilliant news. Within the tunnel they were in when they finally noticed, rocks had stopped falling from the ceiling; each breath was no longer an exercise in caution as they fought to stay still enough that collapse be staved off. A particularly devastating cut from one such falling boulder had nearly devastated Rowan, resulting in the blankets being sacrificed, and though they knew that the sheets (made from the clothes and jumpsuits of the clones that perished, may they rest in peace) would be useful and the nights would be cold it was so much easier, *so* much easier to just tear them up into bandages and patch up the gashed arm; it was so hot in the tunnels- the blankets weren't even necessary- and Rowan was just dying for some relief from this infinite torture that had been their life for the past months and for hundreds of years before that, a purgatory, an exercise in despair, a monotonous servitude that stole away memories and minds and just: it would be amazing to have some cool relief and help the arm stay covered. The arm was bandaged, the dressings were burned with every change to conserve fuel, and the ascent continued, some of the enthusiasm waning but the dream still remaining strong. Rowan kept climbing, kept ignoring the pain and the suffering as they filled their minds with pictures of the surface. At this point, perhaps 3 kilometers were all that were left. 

Another month had gone away, and with it an eye did as well, gouged out by a nasty fall down a hill, with more of the old clothing being sacrificed. Two of the bodies were gone, completely, their waters and nutrients being reduced to broths and being used to sustain Rowan 91, providing any inkling of kinetic momentum to allow life to continue. The bag, lined with insulation panels that had fallen in the descent, had managed to keep the corpses cold during the stay- but it was only barely enough to keep rot away. The putrefaction of the corpses had begun, and as such, Rowan had gone through the human and guma first, choosing to save the mostly rot-resistant Oleas for later, a wise choice considering the dreary state of the leftover parts. Salt helped preserve the food, found in the remains of a salty river that had trickled down through the kilometers of cavern, some exposed a many years ago due to a fault, some merely holes in the ground connected by fracking, and all of it the same, desolate landscape. It, of course, came too late for the human, but a month was still just enough time for the cold guma flesh to stay intact, and the salt could act. The walls had become steeper, requiring much more preparation to climb, especially with some that were near vertical. A shard of metal, likely magnetic due to it's appearance in a magnet-rich mine, provided a semi-useful "ice pick" that Rowan had as aid, and the ascent continued. The worst enemy wasn't lack of food, or water, or the buildup of exhaustion, or any of the other things trying to kill them, but the depression. That hopelessness would keep creeping up, but it was always, *always* stifled by the mind of Rowan. Acknowledging it and moving on, focusing rather on one step ahead than the entirety of the task lent the endurance needed to complete the grand work, and Rowan was able to continue.

Continuing some 4 months after being stranded, with the Spider almost certainly having moved on- the signals of the trackers couldn't be visible from underground, Rowan caught a glimpse of light. The single beam of Thrash-light shining through a dusty haze from a tiny hole in the middle of a ravine was enough to bring tears to Rowan's eye, certainly not the first during the stay, but definitely the first due to joy. Finally! They were so close, it could be tasted. The food was only just waning, and worst case scenario, Rowan could stand another month in the mineshaft. A frenzied energy filled them, and they began ascending even more rapidly, the hours stretching on by and sleep becoming light. A day passed, than another, until Rowan found another tunnel sloping upwards at the top of a particularly harrowing section of rock. At the top was a shiny face, thinly coated with some ore that reflected just enough light for Rowan to see themselves. Hair, matted and shaggy from four months without shaving (as mandated for all clones) hung down, and grime managed to suffuse every cell of their body, leading to a soot-covered appearance. Rowan was comforted by the closeness of the surface as the walked into the dark tunnel and began climbing higher.

Finally, after yet another month, the light of the cave Rowan was in grew brighter. 91 iterations had led to this, the final stand of a guma escaping from torture and servitude, and it was magnificent. Rowan walked out into an opening, circular in nature and some 50 paces across, open in the ceiling, some 50 meters above, to the sky. The glorious, beautiful sky, colored rich blues and purple by the pure light of Thrash, calling out to Rowan in a melancholic, melodies thrum, eagerly awaiting Rowan to come forth and claim it's glory. Dropping the bag, now nearly empty of all provisions, and shrugging off any impeding clothes, for this was the slickest and most difficult climb yet, Rowan flexed the muscles that protruded against the skin from the months of backbreaking exercise, and began to climb. Each foothold and handhold was child's play, it was Rowan's life, Rowan's lifeblood in the caverns, desperate scrambling in the pitch black where light failed to reach and any slip could mean death; the ascent continued with each, their tight fingers grasping on to any crimps and fastening them to the wall, harshly, rests, infrequent as they may be, providing all the time to sweat away any drainage and continue, their brain thrummed with excitement! Everything was lining up, it was finally time! Rowan continued, their breathing increasing in depth and rapidity, the beautiful wretch from the pit who had survived more than any iteration before and proved it possible for Rowan to survive crawling up the wall, scaling faster and faster, practically running up as their heart soared and a cheer, triumphant, exuberant, giving off all the joy and emotions at freedom, pouring out the stress and grief that had built up in a tremendous relief; they were here! They made it! They were free! They saw a shadow! And fell back, dead, into the pit.

Rowan 92 stared down at the... thing that emerged from a bit, warbling a croaked chirp as it walked up, it's skin both sickly pale and ashen grey at the same time, the hair not neat but ragged, the muscles seeming to burst with veins, the fingers being made of reinforced iron, the arm necrotizing in it's bandaged cast, the eye gouged out and filled with pus. It was disgusting. Not even a guma anymore, not even worth calling a person. Rowan 91 didn't know what pit it had crawled out of (or rather, they did), but it must have been a nightmare. The damn fool had forgotten to remove any of the trackers, correctly assuming they couldn't work underground but forgetting about any pings from them the second line-of sight was restored. The tiny buds, the only things that Cathan had invested fortunes into making magnetically resistant, had sent off a signal the moment Rowan saw that first bit of light. It was only natural that Rowan 92 be sent to contain it, as an example of the depravity that escape led to, as a reminder to serve their sentence and lead a proper life once it was over. Nothing was easier than plunging the obsidian spear into the heart of the corrupted clone and resuming the monotony of work.

Rowan 92 died some 10 years later, after tripping and falling out of Spider in transit, a careless death, but tragic nonetheless. For Rowan 93, it was a rock falling and crushing them as well as the entire team assigned, the blood pooling out and serving as a reminder of unstable ground, yet one that was promptly ignored as Cathan moved in the extract more magnets. Rowan's 94-96 were infected with a plague, spread cyclically across Forwards and killing the clones without immunity (as the new bodies lacked the resistant cells); this lasted about 6 years before Cathan finally released a cure to the strange virus. And so it continued, the clock of Rowan's sentence ticking down as their increment ticked up- until it reached a tipping point. Rowan 100, the first triple-digited iterant of the guma formerly known as Rowan, was a wretched thing- seemingly hunched in a mixture of weariness and shame at having died so many times; they were granted a new form of ostracization by the younger clones, those who were still in their earlier generations, yet they were welcomed by the older clones as a young child in their eyes, compared to some of the numbers, 100 was akin to a baby. It brought disgust and rage to Rowan, expanding through their heart until it felt as if a volcano was erupting, molten magma boiling up from below the surface in spilling out in tirades and rants and torrential bouts of anger, driven into the world by a sense of despair and anger for having been imprisoned for so long, building up until Rowan just had to act, needed to act, needed to do anything, just anything that could possibly help them be seen, be respected or understood by the other clones, by the staff, by the overseers that knew Rowan as nothing but a number some 400 years into captivity, a servant forced to work and toil in the pits of a fiery inferno, burning away any semblances of sapience until nothing was left but a pitted husk- Rowan just couldn't explain the indescribable feelings that kept applying pressure, everything was wrong, the other clones seemed to laugh, Spider seemed to lurch about with frenzy that mocked Rowan, something was wrong, every word spoken by others was a cryptic insult aimed at Rowan and just, something was wrong. Rowan 100 snapped. In a tearful stupor, they broke off a wooden chair leg and ran through Spider, stabbing any of the clones (who offered little resistance out of compassion and empathy) and slewing some 4 dozen of their fellow prisoners, before a bolt from a hand wielded ballista tore through their head and shut down the rampage. An additional quarter was missed on account of the intense restructuring of Rowan's mind and the proximity to an intercept that coincided with the spree of violence. 

Rowan 101 opened their eyes with an unnatural sense of calm, the awakening less jarring than normal, despite an ever-present gap in memory. Everything was blunted, the hormones and neurotransmitters of the body being dulled in response to the collapse of Rowan 100; duties were temporarily slackened for the clone as they were mercifully given a week or so of rest whilst Spider was in transit- breakdowns, while infrequent, were not obscenely rare, and some of the staff would feel empathy, providing a week- all that was possible to slip between the cracks of bureaucracy- for old fashioned R&R, a break to allow recuperation; additionally, Rowan 101 was exempted from oversight positions and given more quiet, solitary jobs- anything to help with the stress. The break wasn't that long though, and the meat grinder was pleasantly waiting for Rowan 101 to return, which they did with a more relaxed mind, conforming to the harsh conditions with a self-positive approach that reassured the compatriots and helped to calm the senses of the staff watching. It was with this calm and reassured attitude that Rowan 101 began planning escape, drawing upon the thoughts of past iterations to help construct a glorious plan, one not limited in scope of time nor scale- Rowan was indestructible, a concrete monument of resilience, a paragon of thought and solitude; the plan would take time, though, and would need to be done with care. Rowan 92 had been given ample time to study Rowan 91's progress through the last month of the ascent, and despite the previous version's disdain for 91, Rowan 101 couldn't help but feel admiration and pride for the reveal that they could survive the harshest conditions for months on end, coming out arguably stronger for it. There were, of course, flaws to work out. The first was speed. Anything Rowan 101 did needed to be done in between intercepts, to ensure Eryn 7 couldn't send backup to Forwards. As such, there was a maximum of 4 months, a quarter-stund, that could be used. Additionally, the staff would quickly catch wind of the escape, and unless trackers were forcibly removed, it would be all too easy for Rowan to be captured and killed, with Rowan 102 being readjusted as needed. There, of course, was the issue of Rowan being labelled as "problematic:" with enough escape attempts, Cathan might resort to complete memory wiping upon cloning and mandated replacements once every few stunds to ensure obedience. More time would be needed, at least a century. This, of course, gave an immense timeframe for planning, and it would be easy to come up with successful means of escape. 

Rowan 101 continued with the planning- as did Rowan 102, 103, 104, 105, and so on, all the way up to Rowan 112, who, with 500 years of internment upon Forwards, had come up with a foolproof plan to escape. The plan was as follows. First, Rowan 112 would carve out every tracker and place them with another clone, Tracy 302 (an ancient relic that had been interned for money laundering some 2500 years ago), who had volunteered to stand under a falling boulder and be crushed, by far the most common form of death for the miners; ideally, this would lead to the conclusion that Rowan had died in the same accident. Secondly, Rowan would begin moving through the digsite-carrying a pillowcase filled with rations in their pack- taking the tunnels to avoid being seen, using the pickaxe when needed as a cover, in case questioned; most left them alone and figured they were needed ats some other part of the mine. After successfully leaving, Rowan would wait in a far corner, hiding in some crevasse or another until they could be certain the Spider moved on, with the rations being measured out to ensure survival. After a month or two, when Spider left and Eryn reached it's apoapsis, Rowan would move, running through the wilderness to find a tether station. Though compasses wouldn't work, on account of the magnetic fields, the tethers could be seen from kilometers away, and it would be easily to find. Every once in a while, ships would come directly to a tether hub in space to pick up shipments more easily, and it was that hope that propelled Rowan. The plan was set in stone, the allies were prepared, and the food was ready; It was time to wait for a site to be chosen and Eryn to intercept. 

***

Cathan Lyra Colm 3 was a young man, only just in his 90's, who had been assigned as an overseer of the Spider some 20 years ago, directed by his father, where he currently dwelled, his father being the owner of a publishing house subsidized by Cathan goods; he had seen nothing but peace and smooth operations during his time, with a few accidental deaths entirely out of his view- his father, of course, had transferred him to guard a prison planet to teach the young boy a lesson, help him understand the world- and so, it came as some surprise when Colm saw a boulder plummet onto a group of 10 or so clones, clustered around each other eating lunch; the blood splattering onto his face and the vomit plunging onto his shoes: *how odd*, he wondered, *where did that come from?* instantly prompting a fainting and reassignment to a safer area where he could manage the numbers, his father's lesson taught. For Rowan 112, it meant success; the clones were dead, the trackers crushed, and they escaped narrowly, covered in blood from gouged out devices (concealed by the crowd pretending to eat)- it took but a moment to slip off into the crowd of compliant drones, thinking of course that the unrecognizable figure was leaving after the gruesome scene. Nobody noticed the bag slung over the shoulder being twice regulation. Nobody noticed the pickaxe almost loosely held when it should have been dropped in shock. And nobody noticed when Rowan 112 walked into a tunnel that had been marked off as unsafe.

Every step Rowan took sent dust cascading from the ceiling and onto their shoulders, the soot making it nearly impossible to breath, the dark filling their eyes until it threatened to block out even the memories of light. It was nearly impossible to continue. But Rowan knew that failure, turning back, would certainly mean death as the overseers realized they had gouged out the devices in an obvious attempt to escape, looking to slip by the blind eyes undetected. The unbearable pressure bore down on Rowan, and made them wonder how 91 had managed to go on for 5 months when death would have been easier. But with each footfall, each step trudged onwards, Rowan continued. What started as grueling through the pain became manageable, and bandages smuggled in advance made for easy dressing of the wounds. The caves were cold, this high up, and without Thrash beating down, Rowan was constantly shivering. Every miner was meant to be in a group, and as such, it was expected to always be warm with the heat of other bodies; clothing was less provided. But, with enough time- likely an hour or two, enough for the trail to have gone cold- Rowan finally saw light at the end of the tunnel. Brushing underneath another line of caution tape revealed a small quarry, dug out by clones and excavated by the same. All around them, life thrived, with small talk filling the air and staff lazily watching from above. Presumably. It was impossible to see from the ledge Rowan found themselves under, and as such, it was all too easy to blend in with some other miners, walking out with the pickaxe strewn over their shoulder. No trackers existed out here, not in a state of ease; no one wanted to risk a magnetic flare picking up the metal and flinging it to the abyss. The hardest part was yet to come, though, as Rowan needed to know where they were and how close to the wilderness they made it too. So it was that they went up to a guard and opened their aching throat.\
"Excuse me!" Rowan cried, and one of the watchers stared up blankly. Rowan tried not to tremble with anticipation: "how far is the Spider? I need to piss." The guard clearly thought them a moron.
"It's been what, 10 hours and you already forgot? It's maybe 5 kilos that way, wait until the end of the day." Without another word, Rowan walked back into the mine, struggling not to smile. After an hour or so, Rowan returned to the ledge they had crossed under and skulked into the cave, pausing once inside to ensure nobody saw them. A few minutes backtracking revealed a crevasse, large enough to fit maybe 4 guma, and completely enshrouded by darkness through its bends. Bile built up in their throat, but that wouldn't stop them- Rowan crept through the claustrophobic opening and laid back in the opening, deciding to sleep. Nothing followed for the next two months except for sleeping and eating the bare minimum.

Finally, the rumbling stopped. After another week to be sure, Rowan peeled themselves from the hole, blinking light into their eyes for the first time in months. Rowan 92 had vibrant memories of 91, and the contrast could not be clearer. Whereas 91 was resplendent with glorious musculature, every vein bulging from the climb through kilometers of caves, fueled by the protein of fallen comrades (presumably, as there wouldn't be any other food down there), 112 was a skinny wretch, sustained only by the food stolen from the cafeteria aboard Spider, the bones visible through skin, the hair kept trimmed short by an obsidian razor packaged beforehand. It took everything 112 had not to be ashamed in their lack of stature. But, escape was escape, and they aimed to succeed where 91 had failed; this vibrancy propelled them onwards through the cave and into the light of the quarry. The previously active site had fallen into disuse, large holes marring the face of the rock like scars on flesh. Every step was agony, the atrophied muscles protesting vigorously, and it would have caused Rowan to give up had it not been for circumstance. The worst part about it all was knowing that a replacement had already been issued, Rowan 113 going through and living a peaceful, albeit laborious life with the rest of Cathan Goods; they must be wrought with the uncertainty of knowing if the escape worked, and, barring that, with the despair of realizing they would be trapped still. But 112 would preserve their consciousness, the stream of thought that kept them moving forwards in the quarry. Determination. It was their main companion through the endeavor, and it was surging strongly. 112 left the quarry an hour later, and looked around to see no life in sight. All was quiet. As such, they began the trek towards a tether station, dimly visible in the distance as a sweeping pole tearing through the cloudy sky.

After a month of travel, Rowan 112 had arrived at the tether. Every few hours, one would fall and seemingly land at the base of operations for Forwards, a carbon-based mechanism that just might have been the most beautiful thing imaginable. Rowan had staked it out for days at this point, the paths of the guards branching through their mind and carving channels through their awareness. It all made sense. Rowan began by waiting until night, when the pale hues of the sky had faded away and all that was left was a starry expanse, untainted by light pollution here on a planet where technology itself rebelled. Every step was stifled, nary a whisper being produced as Rowan slunk through the grass and towards the facility. The guards didn't care too much; if anything, they were a formality, sent to Forwards to be able to claim patriotism on resumés; nobody ever invaded, there was nothing to protect against. Were it not for their disheveled appearance, Rowan could've walked in and they wouldn't have cared, especially since no prisoners had been reported missing. The tethers were automated, with them coming on a fixed schedule, and what once was majesty had faded away into the mundane as Rowan stared up from behind the walls. They'd swoop in and hop on a tether, wearing stolen equipment (from one of the sheds) to survive the void- once in orbit on one of the more permanent stations, they could arrange transport and freedom. They climbed the short wall, meant more for predators and native fauna than a guma trying to escape, and landed silently on the other side. No one was around. The shed was unlocked- a tent flap all but separating it from the rest of Forwards, and nobody decided to watch it for intrusions. So Rowan had it easy crawling through and grabbing a suit with an oxygen tank attached, everything needed to survive the void for some 40 hours (a poor quality suit, as most would have at least 1000 hours) in space. Now, all that was left was to wait.

The tether descended, flames curling off of it as it tore through the flimsy atmosphere towards Rowan, a glowing specter of glory, a phoenix, coming to save them from the inferno of Forwards, the answer to all the questions of escape, the meaning to Rowan's existence, the pearl of the world in the palm of their hands. And Rowan was going to ride it. As it slowed, seemingly, and came to a near-complete stop, they did one final check before running forwards, ready to escape. With a triumphant leap, and a mad scramble, Rowan ascended to the roof of the pod and laid back flat. Unlike the passenger pods, this one was meant for cargo, and wouldn't rotate to keep contents upright- Rowan would need to hang on. As they caught their breath and the pod began to ascend, a brief moment of pure joy filled Rowan's heart as they realized they had succeeded. As a result, they weren't focused on the turbulence, and when a blast of wind came and hit the pod, Rowan 112 slipped without a care in the world.

***

Rowan 113 woke up, the last day a hole in their memory. Jarring every time, but this time in particular. For instead of the familiar confines of the Spider, their own personal inferno, nothing laid in front of Rowan except for darkness and a shadowy figure. Something was most definitely wrong.
