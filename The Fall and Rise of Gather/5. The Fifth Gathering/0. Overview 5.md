## Cloning

^639685

A major plot element of the 5th Gathering. Various Crèches chose to deal with these iterations differently, with different populations putting more value on the individuality of clones and others focusing on the potential to "back up" a consciousness. 

### Aevum
When cloning was developed and the Crèches were made to vote, Aevum took a hard stance on the freedom of clones. In this realm of law and justice, the clones were considered their own people, and backing up personalities is highly illegal ([[Eternity in a Day]]). Using an iterative number in names is frowned upon, and it is constantly a source of inter-Crèche strife when outsiders bring their foreign names into the great stretches of territory. There was once a mass lynching when a specific Lucis Mary 1273 entered into a bar and requested a drink. The locals were not amused when Lucis Mary 1274 came into town the next day and requested the same exact drink.
