*%%A story set at an internment facility where a clone attempts to escape over an exceedingly long life.%%*
It was a short fall through the barren void of space, decrepit and desolate, isolating and cold, frozen and radiant, burning with effervescent light, hurtling with infinite movement, tranquility without meaning, causation without citations of meaning or relevance, turning through the vacuum in a thrall of momentum, pulling bodies into its warm embrace, sucking at the pitted surfaces of the crafts, sailing upon winds of stars, peaceful and violent: chaos in motion. Eryn 7, a station constructed in the heart of a moon- hollowed out for purposes beyond comprehension- flung herself through the night sky towards Forwards, a planet of moderate renown, marked only by the ever-present magnetic field that burns the very atmosphere of the planet. Thrash, a magnetar first discovered in the second Gathering's rapid expansion, provides harsh fields that both destroy the prospects of technology, and colonization, of Forwards and exudes bounties of magnets; glorious things with Curie temperatures higher than anything else extractable en masse, capable of generating immense forces, and exceedingly crucial to the stability of Gather: the Hollow Empire herself. Texts, recordings, and memories from the Fourth Gathering lend credence to ideas of magnets capable of moving entire planets with masses of only a gram, or densities impossibly high, things embodying the idea of attraction themselves they're so potent in the tales. And tales they are, as any of these miraculous materials are all but lost to the ravages of time, space, and trade: broken apart into smaller pieces, more crucial, more vulnerable, until the very dust that holds together Dyson spheres becomes remembered with a fade, as a fad upon the universe, a collective hallucination of technology irreparable by "modern" engineering. These magnets are gone. They will *never* return. But more must come, maintenance must be maintained, society must continue pushing forward; power will be served. So it comes as no surprise that Cathan Goods holds a stronghold on Forwards, absolved with the self-serving benefaction of good- feelings, emotions, and publicity in their entirety- that allows them to make absurd profits (for isn't that the name of the game? the dust is blown away, the cracks are spreading, and a paste, a slapdash effort for a
