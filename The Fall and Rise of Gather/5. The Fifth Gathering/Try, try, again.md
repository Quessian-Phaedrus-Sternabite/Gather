It was a short fall through the barren void of space, decrepit and desolate, isolating and cold, frozen and radiant, burning with effervescent light, hurtling with infinite movement, tranquility without meaning, causation without citations of meaning or relevance, turning through the vacuum in a thrall of momentum, pulling bodies into its warm embrace, sucking at the pitted surfaces of the crafts, sailing upon winds of stars, peaceful and violent: chaos in motion. Eryn 7, a station constructed in the heart of a moon- hollowed out for purposes beyond comprehension- flung herself through the night sky towards Forwards, a planet of moderate renown, marked only by the ever-present magnetic field that burns the very atmosphere of the planet. Thrash, a magnetar first discovered in the second Gathering's rapid expansion, provides harsh fields that  destroy both the prospects of technology and colonization of Forwards and generates bounties of magnets; glorious things with Curie temperatures higher than anything else extractable en masse, capable of generating immense forces, and exceedingly crucial to the stability of Gather: the Hollow Empire herself. Texts, recordings, and memories from the Fourth Gathering lend credence to ideas of magnets capable of moving entire planets with masses of only a gram, or densities impossibly high, things embodying the idea of attraction themselves they're so potent in the tales. And tales they are, as any of these miraculous materials are all but lost to the ravages of time, space, and trade: broken apart into smaller pieces, more crucial, more vulnerable, until the very dust that holds together Dyson spheres becomes remembered with a fade, as a fad upon the universe, a collective hallucination of technology irreparable by "modern" engineering. These magnets are gone. They will *never* return. But more must come, maintenance must be maintained, society must continue pushing forward; power will be served. So it comes as no surprise that Cathan Goods holds a stronghold on Forwards, absolved with the self-serving benefaction of good- feelings, emotions, and publicity in their entirety- that allows them to make absurd profits (for isn't that the name of the game⸮ the dust is blown away, the cracks are spreading, and a paste, a slapdash effort for a network of trillions to sustain an empire, is poured) on selling these magnets. Selling, transporting, it's all the same; magnets, like money or water, flow at the pace of honey. Everyone needs them, wants them, will get them: it's only a matter of how. Things happen, whether approved or not, and will continue to happen unless stopped, which is liable to never happen, despite happenings. 

Thrash thrashes Forwards, beats it mercilessly, and as such, destroys any foothold Cathan has on the mild planet. Their technology they so rely on fails, every loss signaling more than inconvenience; it forces a loss of wealth and power necessary, if not itself the point, of controlling Forwards. The planet rejects them, spits in the face of their subjugation, and as such, requires care in approach. There are four or so times that Eryn 7 can contact Forwards, through specialized equipment in their Helmholtz coils, beasts of metal engrossed in metal, projecting a desperate barrier that electromagnetic fields, including radio, microwave, or gamma rays can hardly pierce, active by nature but passive in their connotation; this contact comes only when the orbits intersect ever so slightly, bringing with it shipments, any food that can't be grown, shielded technology, materials, tools, clothing, textiles, and most importantly: clones. The lifebringing clones that enable colonization, enable labor, enable the extraction of magnets and the production of the greatest resource known to the Fifth Gathering, or at least one of the dozens; the clones themselves are the most potent of tools: they think only enough to live, are expendable, and they follow orders out of some sort of demented self-preservation. The higher a clone's number, the less respect they command; a system manufactured by the wardens of their narcissistic prisons to keep everyone in line. Control, after all, is the only thing more valuable than currency, despite them being one and the same.

On the surface, a spider crawls across the landscape. Not of flesh, chitin, or anything else a biological spider may have; this one is partially biological but purely mechanical, containing a micro-ecosystem of life: humans, guma, and even olea "thrive" atop this spider of wood. For wood works- metal, motors, anything remotely ferrous would be sucked up, thrown around, or rendered useless by the magnetic fields, rocks, and even dust in the air- wood was all but necessary. Olea were made fun of, of course, for being right at home in the immense forests of Forwards, living within the butchered corpses of lives gone longer than anyone in the Fifth Gathering (born then, that is), crawling across the landscape to a new sight seemingly daily, weekly, monthly: it didn't matter. What did matter was the mining, brutally manual, with laborious hours spent toiling away at rocks in hope to find those precious magnets and sustain Gather for just a bit longer. The Spider, as it was "lovingly" called by its inhabitants, was a hulking thing, constructed entirely of woods and plastics and anything else that could be scraped together in some odd construction immune to the dangers of Thrash. The clones often died performing the hard work, especially without the safety equipment and tools to assist them. Towering above all else, at 70 meters tall, the Spider was a city among itself, an Escherian nightmare ironclad in veneer, its passageways turning and twisting in an almost organic shape. The miners, of course, stored any and all gear there, in whatever nook or cranny wasn't filled with fibrous or even normal growths; such as were common atop the Spider. It seemed to stretch from end to end several kilometers, and it was an unspoken pact that no one should be allowed to know it to the full extent. Every second, every night failing that, the clones' brains were ported to a server, a database of biological wetware seeming to grow through the Spider, the only thing that could contain data in the presence of such a field. Such was Cathan's nature, their specialty since the very beginning, and so the clones were limiting to backing up while on the crawl. Any perishing was met with forwarding to the necessary parties aboard Eryn and subsequent restoral to the rightful place of mining that the clones belonged to. Questions of deserving were levied often, but relentlessly answered by wardens provided naught an opportunity of escape. What started as debt and ended in death- whether by the Company, in service to the Company, or through chance- the indenture of the slaves (for that's what they were), started at death and lasted until either someone went through a long enough time, paid off their debt (unlikely), or went through enough iterations, whichever came last- failing the second. It was with this that Spider became populated, thousands of minds stored in eternal limbo; a cycle of resurrection and rebirth being thrown into their faces, every death an increase in owing as an rule of nature (sparked upon naturally by the incredible cost of making a clone [still less than the magnets sold for]), every day forced to work until they couldn't anymore, every life snuffed out replaced by one fresh and ready to go. And the memories carried over. Some clones tried to escape (to no avail, as it was nearly impossible), while others were merely petrified with the eternal life presented in the timespan they signed away. The thought was depressing. 

Above it all lay Eryn, with an orbit intersecting Forwards 4 times, providing numerous windows of opportunity for transfer; the less fuel required, the better. Forward would sweep through the stars, starting at a distance far enough away from Thrash to be able to communicate, receive supplies, and send off shipments, draw near enough to Thrash to necessitate DNA storage of data within reinforced chambers and a prolonged hibernation of all employee's to ensure no lasting damage, ending again at a lonely pinprick distant from Thrash and Forwards combined. On these intersects, if it was needed (which it always was), Clones would be shot down to the planet, supplies would be hurled up, and homeostasis would continue. Trillions were made this way, the money flowing into Cathan Goods and the magnets flowing out, a paradigm of perfect profits and persnickety processing; all was well. Except for the clones, that is. 

Within the Spider were untold bunks, assigned to no one and everyone simultaneously, each outfitted with a long, spindly needle to hijack the brain's contents and record everything: memories, experiences, useful resources, upon which anything not useful to the company was discarded (storage was limited, consciousness is cheap, and besides: the brain is resilient) and the knowledge of an indent, for that was what they were called- they relished in their servitude, and those who didn't despaired silently- was preserved for quick replication. Drift occurred, as was expected when a large portion of what makes a person themself is stripped away for efficiency's sake, and personalities suffered. For many, this was fine. One of those "unnecessary" qualities happened to be resentment, or just strong emotions in general, and so most couldn't care about the horrors they endured, the long hours, the possible destruction of their biologies providing nary a doubt in their minds as they continued their forced slavery. For most, it started with debt. A simple thing, really, in an age where surplus expired and currencies became mandate- iron laws to bind people together like the connections of old. Debt was a natural response, an adaptation of the system to ensure power could be maintained, purchases could be carried out, and Gather could carry on in Empire. Each Crèche dealt with debt differently, ranging from community service to temporary shame to, as seen in Cathan, internment. This, of course, lay behind the veil of governmental and corporate monotony as a last resort, only the most dire consequences to the most dire of people. Upon entering into a contract with a Cathan lender, your identity was signed over to them as collateral, allowing unlimited borrowing with no repercussions; this stayed the case until death. After some edicts by the Aevum Courts, the cloning of a person before death, or even just after death without consent (as provided by Cathan's predatory contracts) was strictly prohibited- punishable by death and erasure from any of the Seven's databases. So Cathan waited, silently hoping for the deaths of their customers until they could redeem their collateral and force suffering, deletion of personality even, upon the listless masses that couldn't help but borrow. Arguments were made for ethics, but ignored by Cathan, who claimed that their clones were but partial copies of the originals, and besides, upon release, couldn't they just have the memories removed⸮ So they kept shovelling people into the gullet of Forwards and the Spider, and all was well. 

Cathan Rowan 89 had once had a family, but it had all blurred away. The years had been tough, the labor difficult, and the Spider taking a toll with every death until nearly everything- personality, hopes, dreams, family, philosophies, and even identity was st
