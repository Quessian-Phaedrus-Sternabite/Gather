## Description
What some consider to be the darkest era of Gather, and by extension the universe, the Third Gathering was when the Corruption, a plague able to mutate and conform was released into the galaxy by an unknown alien species. Aliens are discovered, but despite the new population, over 90% of civilization is wiped out. The only survivors are those who were part of Gather, as the immense megacorporations had enough resources to survive. This led to alliances being formed, and tentative peace emerging; regardless, earlier history was all but wiped out, and myths, legends, and word of mouth were all that was left of pre-Gather society.
