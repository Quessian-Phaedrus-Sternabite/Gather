## Description
The Seventh Gathering represents the fall of Gather. Reality itself has begun fraying, and the edges of the universe are slowly unravelling. Unfortunately, humanity, and all other civilization has perished, for the most part. Many small pockets of life remain, however, but dwindle as time goes on. The first story in the book should be the last person in the entirety of the universe.
