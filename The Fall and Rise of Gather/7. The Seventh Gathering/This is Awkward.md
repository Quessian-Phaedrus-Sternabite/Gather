%%Thriving town built out of the relics of Gather finds strange disappearances claiming several citizens. Two youths set out to investigate.%%

When I found her, Martha was sitting on a bench in the woods. It was a strange thing, that bench, made of stone that seemed perfectly shaped for whomever stumbled across the clearing, and despite the vines crawling over and around the bench, it was none the worse for wear. Perhaps it was ancient, and perhaps it had seen many travelers taking a moment to rest their feet and cry, but in this moment, none of them were as real as Martha; the bench cradled and comforted her. Of course, it could have been my imagination. 
I walked up to her, wondering who would leave a child hardly out of toddler-hood alone in the forest. She started at the crunch of my footsteps, and for a brief second, seemed to brighten at the sight of my face. Then the tears fell from her eyes and she broke again, crumbling back into herself while staring anywhere but at me. 
"Is everything alright?" I asked, but my voice only made her sob harder. Seeing no other option, I sat down next to her on the bench, and tried to pat her shoulder reassuringly. Despite being more than twice the size of this little girl, the bench was more comfortable than any chair I'd ever felt, and I wanted nothing more than to lean back and relax in the woods. Of course, before I could drift off, I was returned to my senses by the shaking of the girl. Later, Martha would tell me I was a reminder of the past. She wouldn't explain further.
