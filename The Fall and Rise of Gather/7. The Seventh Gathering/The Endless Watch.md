%%Short story about a group of people on an asteroid in one of the few remaining space stations. Around them, the Seventh Heat Death sets in. One of the researchers unleashes a device that rewinds time, causing it to flow in reverse. After panic, the researcher tries to explain, but the boss berates him. He discusses Law, and how life after death has been Severed during the Fourth. The boy, now panicking, tries to say it's myth, but at this point, it's revealed that the man is several millinea old, one of the last survivors of the Fourth. Around them, the members of the space station begin to be flung out as protections fail, and a grisly death awaits them. Lore wise, this shatters most of that area of space, leaving its contents a mystery%%

A shattered mug drew Michael's attention. The noise shouldn't have bothered him by now, but old habits die hard, and hearing something shatter would always provoke a sort of primal fear in the Captain. As he swiveled, he saw nothing behind him, and sighed. This was easily the tenth time today that a noise had splintered or cracked and there was no trace of the source. At first, he had assumed it was some kind of bizarre prank played by a member of the crew, but everyone seemed equally surprised as Michael when the noise went off. It just felt... wrong to ignore something clearly breaking.

In front of Michael, the window gazed out into the abyss. Behind him, the abyss gazed at his soul, stripping away his sanity with every minute he had to stare at existence. It got on one's nerves after a while, forcing constant shift changes and mandated therapy sessions. Being the Captain, it was assumed Michael was immune to this constant inspection, but he served his time as long as anyone else. After all, they had to watch. Someone had to be focused, lest everything up and disappear. Your eyes must drink in every inch of space, every pinprick of star, every glance of the impossibly large void. 

No computers could be used, but nobody complained. It was important work, this watching, and a computer couldn't be trusted with anything more than personal finance and piloting. Still, it became grating without entertainment or conversation, everyone laser focused outside of the window. Concentrating on end for hours at a time is perhaps one of the most difficult things for the human psyche to endure, with a shift taking a day or more to recover, to wash off the sweat and grime of observation. 

Another mug shattered and Captain Michael jumped from his chair, loudly swearing.
"ALL RIGHT," he screamed, the air shaking as everyone looked towards him. "WHOEVER'S DOING THAT NEEDS TO CUT IT OUT!" Some of the crew members winced, but there was nobody to accuse. In the center of the room, where one would assume the noise was coming from, a small water cooler sat, mugs neatly arranged on pegs running the length of the legs. If anything, one might notice a distinct increase in the number of mugs since the start of the cycle.
