I dream of slipping on the pavers and falling, upwards, eternally into the sky. My feet move out from under me and I lose all control as I'm flung into the air. The thoughts assail me whenever I walk, or lay down, or move in any sort of orientation. I feel my skin slough off, the flesh revealing muscle revealing bones, and I consider the truth of human. What is the barest form of humanity? What is the truth behind flesh? We are nothing without our body without our mind without ourselves, and we exist regardless. I can't tell whether we are the sum of our parts or more. Humans are the opposite of truth. there is no intimate form of humanity, no basest reveal of an inner self, and I can't rectify the thought. In these visions as I fall to the sky, it feels as though I am stripped away until nothing and me, me and nothing.  are left.
