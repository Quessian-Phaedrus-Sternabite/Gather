In the 27th year of his life, Cathan Isaac decided to return home. It had been ages since he visited his mothers on Ferve, the small moon he grew up on. The town wasn't much, but Cathan Goods still kept it in it's logs, and Novus engineers still provided maintenance on the power supply. Or at least they had when Isaac had left; it had been almost a decade since then. Isaac had moved away at his mothers' insistence, they told him that an entire universe was out there for him to explore and discover. In his case, the universe was merely a Dyson station a few systems over, good ole' 1783. The station was middle-aged at this point, at least compared to other Dyson stations. Still, it was closer to the core of the galaxy he was in, and most would call it Gather proper. If many were left. The last number he had seen placed the population of the Andromeda Galaxy as less than 100 trillion. Astonishing, really, considering how that many people used to live there. Here on the edge of civilized space, reality itself seemed to blur at times, with people being few and far between. He had always hated it growing up; felt like being alone in an endless world with no one else to hear you. But if there was one thing that made it all right, it was Clair, his birthplace and perhaps favorite city in the world. Population 80, give or take 10, Clair was nothing more than some homes, three (incredible) restaurants
