When I awoke, two things immediately caught my mind. First, was the corpse--or at least I think it was, just looking at it made my head spin and stomach drop--and the doorknob it was impaled upon. I stared. On the metal doorknob, the "face" was skewered as if some hand reached down, picked up the person, and simply placed the two together. And it protruded, far out the other side of the skull in a twisty sort of way, stretching what was, for all intents and purposes, a normal doorknob into a spear-shaped haft of space, the head contorting around it to fulfil the impalement. The doorknob had a logo on it. A simple, yet stylish "H," superimposed over an exploding star. I then realized with a burst that I could read, and that I couldn't write out my name.

It wasn't that I couldn't write. The muscle memory was there, as was a faint sense that, had I tried, I could've penned a paper there and now. No, it was a burning hole in my memory where my identity and name used to lie, and I was on the brink of falling in. A noise pulled me back; the corpse and doorknob were sliding down the wall, leaving a trail of blood and crumpled steel in the motley assembly's wake. I ignored it. More important was the fact that the corpse seemed almost familiar, the visage of an Old Man visible even through the crumbled view of the face. It stared at me while I focused, trying to remember anything. Looking at the corpse made it worse; parts of my body seemed to freeze up as they seized from the cells' rebellion, the very act of staring causing my muscles to revolt. Again, though, I ignored it. More captivating was the fact that the body moved, meaning it couldn't have been here for too long, meaning I probably was involved in killing it. Whatever the fuck "it" is.

A step forward brings my face into contact with the doorknob, and the worst pain of my (albeit short) life. It feels like pulling your hand away from flypaper, caught in a trap that sucks back and nearly distorts the skin, the ligaments being the only thing preventing it from just ripping off and being obliterated by the sticky embrace. This on top of the mind-pummeling fact that the doorknob remains several meters away, and yet it feels like I've collided with a thin bar stretching both ways in front of me. If the corpse heard my screams, it didn't react. 

So I ran away, as much as a could, turning away from the grizzle and probing the room, searching carefully for a way out of this poor Man's tomb. The walls are white, devoid of anything, and the material shorn off by the doorknob's point lies white on the floor as well. Everything is sharp, yet out-of-focus, lending the world a blurry cadence that feels like it cuts into my soul and leaves me not knowing if my eyes are messed up or reality is. I brush my hand against the blur and it cuts, blades of space seeming to faintly resist the movement as my hand it overlaid on top of it. It's almost like looking at a photo; the central plane is in focus whilst everything behind and in front is messed up, distorted. The only thing that stands out, however, is that same Man and His doorknob, the two of them only existing within the confines of the central room. 

Of course, this begs the question: if I'm in some kind of featureless room with a corpse and a doorknob--what does the doorknob open? With a sigh, I decide to take the plunge and grab the doorknob, by the knob this time, and pull it from the man's face. A noise builds as a draw near, as if cell death was being amplified and blasted directly into my skull, reverberating over and over until I can't hear anything but the noise, the Old Man's radiation stripping away my very being and my flesh, boiling away as I bring the hand nearer until the very skin is dripping off, acid tabs popping as the world distorts and reality seems to converge on the corpse's face, it's hollow gaze piercing me and stabbing into my heart until

I touch the doorknob and my mind feels clearer than ever. It cuts through the din and stands out, pointing an arrow in some... other direction that leads away from this Old Man and towards an infinity of other doors just waiting to be open. Forgive me, of course, but I walk towards the nearest one. And reality shifts, and I shift, and it feels like my mind is breaking again and it feels like the photo has gone out of focus completely and I feel like I'm sliding with no pants on and I'm falling down and up and all around and the door gets closer as I try to walk to it and fall, in a tangled heap, in front of the door with the Man somehow inside of me and yet above me at the same time and it's out of focus too and everything is but a hair of dust and the

On its own accord, my hand reaches out and

Turns the knob. It pierced reality before, and now is no different. The space opens up to another one, remarkably clear with every detail visible and all the edges sharp. Hairs flit around here and there, dust in my vision; as a whole, however, I seem to be all in one place. My eyes drop to the doorknob, and I see what looks like the room's reflection fading away and becoming more blurry, staying in the same spot yet moving away rapidly. It hurts to think about, but is fine so long as I keep my hand tight. The doorknob refuses to be put down. For the first time, I consider the thought that the Old Man hadn't been slaughtered by a person, but by this thing in my grasp.

I need to find its maker. Instinctually, I know it's the only thing that can free me, and yet the very thought fills me with despair. Something about the sheer scale of wherever I am, and the sheer amount of *everything* I'd need to delve through to find out who made this. And yet, associated with failure is a sense of death, as if this doorknob had saved my life and would end it if given the chance, but so long as I kept looking, it would wait. The arrows hadn't disappeared either.

With a thought, I try to dismiss them.  They stubbornly refuse, their gossamer points continuing to stretch off in a headaching blur. Without knowledge, I'm aware of where they end; the butts tell me. No information about the place, but simply a location, as if they're an infinite map that somebody forgot to paint. Meanwhile, a glance up at the sky shows an infinitely larger amount, where every possible door in the Universe lies waiting to be opened. Several large ones stand out, pointing towards something that seems to end as a rift in the middle of nowhere; without sight, however, I have no idea if it's just too far to see. An idea strikes me.

What if, instead of reducing the arrows, I increase them; whatever counts as a door begetting an arrow? Instantly, the world becomes awash as a vector field that penetrates down to the atom, the doors in my cell screaming at me as the knob opens them without my consent, the doors in my atoms doing likewise as my hand is changed into a block of lead by electron transfer, a surge of pain and energy thrumming up my arm until I scream, with all the fury I can muster, 

"STOP."

It does. My hand burns, but looks fine; the skin is unmarred and the cells are intact. I don't know if it was some wretched premonition or some divine warning, but nothing seems to have happened. That doesn't stop the pull, or the doorknob trying to wrench open the doors before being stopped by my overworked brain. Yet I'm fine, the arrowing simply coating me as docile as a trillion wasps, waiting to sting. It's fine. The landscape is blanketed with them, every plant and animal tearing open with a call, ready to submit to the handle I grasp. Intuitively, I feel the knowledge of every living being in the entirety of the Universe, calling to be, broadcasting their location in a storm of information, every planet with life whispering me where it is, quadrillions of them, an infinity, a googolplex of doorways begging to be opened, begging me to open them, yelling at me exactly where they are and how to get there; it doesn't stop there, one infinity wouldn't be cruel enough; a never-ending procession of realities and world's and doorways between them opening up to my inspection, compressing into a pinprick of a cube at the bottom and expanding to unfathomable distances at the top, and all of it is laid bare, all of it is poured into my mind until the old rush of nonstop was just a comfort food, the meal of doors staring me in the face and proverbially stabbing me until I feel that, I too, am dead as a doorknob to the face will get you, the knowledge sucking me in its whirlpool of a grasp and threatening me with drowning, proximity melting away as I feel, and nearly succumb to the call to open the doors, to relent to the doorknob's desire to *open*, to take whatever openings are nearby and force them into being, to stretch mouths into tunnels and cells into gateways, to open them all in a never-ending procession of halls and walls falling apart until I'm reduced to atoms, traversing an infinity of infinitesimally thin doorways that take me decillions of kilometers with every step, every breath; it drives me to insanity and back again in less time than I can blink or breather, the never-ending never-ending never-ending never-ending just overwhelming me with its death, with its calling to open, with the doorways in my mind governing restraint and concern and even just a want to keep life alive (a basic empathy) failing in the face of sheer, impossible power; the ability to instantly tear open and kill every living thing in this Universe, every slightly large cave that could be a doorway, every bend in space that something may creep through, every orifice of every being to ever exist, eldritch creatures and species alike falling in the face of a *fucking doorknob*, stuck with some damned logo on its edge and pointing out in a thing shaft that you'd be surprised wasn't stretching through the firmament beneath you if it wasn't for the fact your mind had cracked long ago, and you can feel the arrows converging, each and every one pointing to a dot that you realize is the future, that you realize is heat death collapsing the entire Universe into nothingness; you gaze upon the works of reality and despair for you are nothing, you're nothing more than a series of doors, of pathways converging to a point that shuffles about and pretends to walk through other doors, that vibrate in patterns of cosmic syzygy, that line up until you burn away into a crisp, and yet that crisp is reassuring, bring sanity back to you as I begin to stare and realize that only one arrow remains, Zeno's that governs, time that dictates, and even it is struggling to stay straight against some shit that just pulls and stretches away until other arrows
