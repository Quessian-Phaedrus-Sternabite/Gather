When I awoke, two things immediately caught my mind. First, was the corpse--or at least I think it was, just looking at it made my head spin and stomach drop--and the doorknob it was impaled upon. I stared. On the metal doorknob, the "face" was skewered as if some hand reached down, picked up the person, and simply placed the two together. And it protruded, far out the other side of the skull in a twisty sort of way, stretching what was, for all intents and purposes, a normal doorknob into a spear-shaped haft of space, the head contorting around it to fulfil the impalement. The doorknob had a logo on it. A simple, yet stylish "H," superimposed over an exploding star. I then realized with a burst that I could read, and that I couldn't write out my name.

It wasn't that I couldn't write. The muscle memory was there, as was a faint sense that, had I tried, I could've penned a paper there and now. No, it was a burning hole in my memory where my identity and name used to lie, and I was on the brink of falling in. A noise pulled me back; the corpse and doorknob were sliding down the wall, leaving a trail of blood and crumpled steel in the motley assembly's wake. I ignored it. More important was the fact that the corpse seemed almost familiar, the visage of an Old Man visible even through the crumbled view of the face. It stared at me while I focused, trying to remember anything. Looking at the corpse made it worse; parts of my body seemed to freeze up as they seized from the cells' rebellion, the very act of staring causing my muscles to revolt. Again, though, I ignored it. More captivating was the fact that the body moved, meaning it couldn't have been here for too long, meaning I probably was involved in killing it. Whatever the fuck "it" is.

A step forward brings my face into contact with the doorknob, and the worst pain of my (albeit short) life. It feels like pulling your hand away from flypaper, caught in a trap that sucks back and nearly distorts the skin, the ligaments being the only thing preventing it from just ripping off and being obliterated by the sticky embrace. This on top of the mind-pummeling fact that the doorknob remains several meters away, and yet it feels like I've collided with a thin bar stretching both ways in front of me. If the corpse heard my screams, it didn't react. 

So I ran away, as much as a could, turning away from the grizzle and probing the room, searching carefully for a way out of this poor Man's tomb. The walls are white, devoid of anything, and the material shorn off by the doorknob's point lies white on the floor as well. Everything is sharp, yet out-of-focus, lending the world a blurry cadence that feels like it cuts into my soul and leaves me not knowing if my eyes are messed up or reality is. I brush my hand against the blur and it cuts, blades of space seeming to faintly resist the movement as my hand it overlaid on top of it. It's almost like looking at a photo; the central plane is in focus whilst everything behind and in front is messed up, distorted. The only thing that stands out, however, is that same Man and His doorknob, the two of them only existing within the confines of the central room. 

Of course, this begs the question: if I'm in some kind of featureless room with a corpse and a doorknob--what does the doorknob open? With a sigh, I decide to take the plunge and grab the doorknob, by the knob this time, and pull it from the man's face. A noise builds as a draw near, as if cell death was being amplified and blasted directly into my skull, reverberating over and over until I can't hear anything but the noise, the Old Man's radiation stripping away my very being and my flesh, boiling away as I bring the hand nearer until the very skin is dripping off, acid tabs popping as the world distorts and reality seems to converge on the corpse's face, it's hollow gaze piercing me and stabbing into my heart until

I touch the doorknob and my mind feels clearer than ever. It cuts through the din and stands out, pointing an arrow in some... other direction that leads away from this Old Man and towards an infinity of other doors just waiting to be open. Forgive me, of course, but I walk towards the nearest one. And reality shifts, and I shift, and it feels like my mind is breaking again and it feels like the photo has gone out of focus completely and I feel like I'm sliding with no pants on and I'm falling down and up and all around and the door gets closer as I try to walk to it and fall, in a tangled heap, in front of the door with the Man somehow inside of me and yet above me at the same time and it's out of focus too and everything is but a hair of dust and the
door
standing
right
there.

On its own accord, my hand reaches out and

Turns the knob. It pierced reality before, and now is no different. The space opens up to another one, remarkably clear with every detail visible and all the edges sharp. Hairs flit around here and there, dust in my vision; as a whole, however, I seem to be all in one place. My eyes drop to the doorknob, and I see what looks like the room's reflection fading away and becoming more blurry, staying in the same spot yet moving away rapidly. It hurts to think about, but is fine so long as I keep my hand tight. The doorknob refuses to be put down. For the first time, I consider the thought that the Old Man hadn't been slaughtered by a person, but by this thing in my grasp.

I need to find its maker. Instinctually, I know it's the only thing that can free me, and yet the very thought fills me with despair. Something about the sheer scale of wherever I am, and the sheer amount of *everything* I'd need to delve through to find out who made this. And yet, associated with failure is a sense of death, as if this doorknob had saved my life and would end it if given the chance, but so long as I kept looking, it would wait. The arrows hadn't disappeared either.

With a thought, I try to dismiss them.  They stubbornly refuse, their gossamer points continuing to stretch off in a headaching blur. Without knowledge, I'm aware of where they end; the butts tell me. No information about the place, but simply a location, as if they're an infinite map that somebody forgot to paint. Meanwhile, a glance up at the sky shows an infinitely larger amount, where every possible door in the Universe lies waiting to be opened. Several large ones stand out, pointing towards something that seems to end as a rift in the middle of nowhere; without sight, however, I have no idea if it's just too far to see. An idea strikes me.

What if, instead of reducing the arrows, I increase them; whatever counts as a door begetting an arrow? Instantly, the world becomes awash as a vector field that penetrates down to the atom, the doors in my cell screaming at me as the knob opens them without my consent, the doors in my atoms doing likewise as my hand is changed into a block of lead by electron transfer, a surge of pain and energy thrumming up my arm until I scream, with all the fury I can muster,

"STOP."

It does. My hand burns, but looks fine; the skin is unmarred and the cells are intact. I don't know if it was some wretched premonition or some divine warning, but nothing seems to have happened. That doesn't stop the pull, or the doorknob trying to wrench open the doors before being stopped by my overworked brain. Yet I'm fine, the arrowing simply coating me as docile as a trillion wasps, waiting to sting. It's fine. The landscape is blanketed with them, every plant and animal tearing open with a call, ready to submit to the handle I grasp. Intuitively, I feel the knowledge of every living being in the entirety of the Universe, calling to be, broadcasting their location in a storm of information, every planet with life whispering me where it is, quadrillions of them, an infinity, a googolplex of doorways begging to be opened, begging me to open them, yelling at me exactly where they are and how to get there; it doesn't stop there, one infinity wouldn't be cruel enough; a never-ending procession of realities and world's and doorways between them opening up to my inspection, compressing into a pinprick of a cube at the bottom and expanding to unfathomable distances at the top, and all of it is laid bare, all of it is poured into my mind until the old rush of nonstop was just a comfort food, the meal of doors staring me in the face and proverbially stabbing me until I feel that, I too, am dead as a doorknob to the face will get you, the knowledge sucking me in its whirlpool of a grasp and threatening me with drowning, proximity melting away as I feel, and nearly succumb to the call to open the doors, to relent to the doorknob's desire to *open*, to take whatever openings are nearby and force them into being, to stretch mouths into tunnels and cells into gateways, to open them all in a never-ending procession of halls and walls falling apart until I'm reduced to atoms, traversing an infinity of infinitesimally thin doorways that take me decillions of kilometers with every step, every breath; it drives me to insanity and back again in less time than I can blink or breathe, the never-ending never-ending never-ending never-ending just overwhelming me with its death, with its calling to open, with the doorways in my mind governing restraint and concern and even just a want to keep life alive (a basic empathy) failing in the face of sheer, impossible power; the ability to instantly tear open and kill every living thing in this Universe, every slightly large cave that could be a doorway, every bend in space that something may creep through, every orifice of every being to ever exist, eldritch creatures and species alike falling in the face of a *fucking doorknob*, stuck with some damned logo on its edge and pointing out in a thing shaft that you'd be surprised wasn't stretching through the firmament beneath you if it wasn't for the fact your mind had cracked long ago, and you can feel the arrows converging, each and every one pointing to a dot that you realize is the future, that you realize is heat death collapsing the entire Universe into nothingness; you gaze upon the works of reality and despair for you are nothing, you're nothing more than a series of doors, of pathways converging to a point that shuffles about and pretends to walk through other doors, that vibrate in patterns of cosmic syzygy, that line up until you burn away into a crisp, and yet that crisp is reassuring, bring sanity back to you as I begin to stare and realize that only one arrow remains, Zeno's that governs, time that dictates, and even it is struggling to stay straight against some shit that just pulls and stretches away until other arrows appear, threatening to overwhelm you, threatening to overwhelm me until I pull back, dictating a door as anything here and now that I can enter or physically touch within a day, and it helps just a little bit until I notice some hunk of a heap of arrows moving rapidly towards me, and my mind screams stop but my mouth just screams, and the heap dissolves in range as every door is opened at once and the collection flies apart, the fibers refusing to hold together as the presumed person goes up in a burst of awesome fission, jaw-dropping steam that pours forward and fills my mouth with its exhumed gas and exhaust from the now-nonexistent person; another breath in and I feel my mind stich itself back together, the memories flowing like toxic sludge into the doorknob as if it was another door, and even that threatens to collapse me as the doorknob considers opening itself, tearing through space in a four or five dimensional rift that would loop around and collapse everything again until you couldn't escape or move or open anything else and I regain myself, tell it to stop, tell it to simply open the mental floodgates holding in the memories and trauma of the last microseconds, of witnessing a person dissolve into nothingness as I see their every atom "open," of anything that threatens to drive me until it all is safely on the knob, and the dread that accompanied burnishing the doorknob anew and pulling out any of mine or others' memories fading as I try to lock the door, turn the key in my mind that will stop me from opening it, another entire breath, 720 a minute, pouring out before I can resume my grasp and assure myself that it will *never* happen again, that the doors will remain shut, that I'll stop before ever opening up another passageway and breaking my poor fragile mind. 

In front of me, a woman clutches her head and screams obscenities at me whilst staring at her wife's impression, a rapidly fading mark on the Universe that previously held a life, the arrows plucking away as I restrain myself and limit scope further, the woman going from a shapeless mass to an understandable being and my mind further solidifying into a pearl of iced cream, shavings coalescing as I blankly stare at her, blankly stare at her mouth, blankly stare in imagined yet unexpressed horror as her pores begin to open up, stretching away into the sky as the rest of her body pulls itself apart, every orifice untangling itself from the knot and the body contorting itself into a torus that unwraps into an infinitely thin, perfect cylinder that aligns on the axis of the doorknob, and it turns again of it's own volition and opens the passageway in front of me, and I walk through the door that was previously a woman and trod across her stretched flesh and gaseous wife, and exist in the middle of another clearing, several kilometers away yet connected by the thought that every cell of DNA in the woman's body would be about this long, or it would be if I was still focusing on cells. 

The grass no longer calls to me. A door is a rectangle, my mind batters out, being nearly ignored but politely acknowledged by the knob, and the world seems to reform. 
With every change, my head becomes clearer, drawing ever closer to the state in that room where there was only a single door I could understand and others that felt like white noise. 
Every door I've open has either stayed open or disappeared, and this was no different. 
From behind me, I can hear more than feel more than see the door closing.
I begin to feel a tumultuous peace as the doorknob limits its scope.
The distances play a role, only *relevant* doors being shown.
My mind clears away as the arrows fade.

All of my thoughts still.
I'm trembling without joy.
Is this what life is?

Vomit spills from my mouth as I realize I just murdered two people, carelessly, barely a thought turning them into literal pathways towards my future. I want nothing more than to fling this wretched doorknob away from my body, into one of the myriad of paths I feel it can open, into any of the holes on the ground that thrum with restrained definition. And I breathe in. 

Bile fills my nostrils as I struggle to inhale, the chunky smell threatening to make me return to hurling. Around me, the quiet forest begins to return to life, the animals returning to their noise as if I opened my ears and they stopped maintaining their vigil.  The pool on the ground has started to settle, acids seeping into the grass and devastating their potential futures. I breathe out and flush my nose, spewing chunks from the openings until I can finally. Breathe. Again. 

My back straightens as I raise my head and begin to surveil the clearing. Around me, all has returned to that noisy quiet that accompanies the paces of life. To my left is a throng of trees, trailing off until I can't even make out the horizon between their trunks. In front and behind me, the same remains true, with trees stretching up until I feel that searching for an end would be pointless. And yet, to my right, there's a small river, trickling down as no more than a creek would, with the notion that it might expand later downstream. There's a feeling behind it, a knowledge that if I follow it, tributaries may combine until it becomes powerful. <!>

For confirmation, I turn to the doorknob. Opening my senses yet again, I slowly push out, expanding my definition of a traversable door until I can start to utilize it. Slowly, every human size hole within a day's walk marks their presence to me, and, seeing nothing of note, I continue to expand the range. Finally, a glimpse occurs--a confederation of passageways that gather around each other and weave in strange, yet delightful, ways. Underneath the simple doors lies patterns, rectangles and plots that betray reasoning, order as if they were placed there. It's a town, a village, a city, a kingdom, something that thrums with meaning and calls my name. There's no doors leading straight there, and while I'm sure I could open a passage, worry seeps into my mind about the control needed. 

Manslaughter follows in my wake, and within only hours of entering this world, I've removed two from it. To risk destroying more life, depriving the Universe of more souls, be they sapient or thoughtless, seems careless, a betrayal of ethics. And besides, with my stride and the tranquil ground, the doors should only be a few days' walk from here. Uneasily, I consider my bodily states, the hunger and thirst that underlies each of my actions.

I haven't yet eaten or drank anything since exiting the room, and evenbefore then, I know not how long I had gone in fast. <!> And yet, thankfully, my stomach is queit and my flesh moist; I should do fine with going a while without sustenance. Worst be, I can use the doorknob as a spear, extending its shaft into a small creature, using its life to preserve mine. That must be a last resort, though.

There is of course disgust at the thought of using the unnatural abilities to tear apart anything--it defies all logic and the laws of this world--but merely hunting feels more... right. I still remember the horrible sucking sensation of the spear though, and my calmer mind rebels at the thought of using it on another living thing. With that, my focus is pulled down onto the length extending from m the knob.

It protrudes in both directions for an infinite length. And yet, the ground is only torn up by it; the blade doesn't pierce, but only retracts (?) as needed. A swing shows the lack of any resistance or weight, and yet it still pulls on my hand with a bizarre torque. Around me, I realize with a start, the world as slightly begun to blur. It's only a smidgen, only a fraction of what it was in that room, but it still feels like I'm viewing a flat photo from above. The blade has a quiet thrum to it, one that makes no audible noise but can be felt, if not heard, as a deep purr. Looking closer at the base, dust is rapidly sucked up and shot through the base of the knob in a spiral pattern greatly exceeding every conceivable speed. The closer it gets to the knob, the faster it moves, and the more *stretched* the dust gets, space compressing as the knob stretches everything around it. It is as such that even one or two meters from the edge, the knob feels to be resting atop the grass directly. 

It feels like a useless weapon. What good is a blunt beam that can be stopped by any shield? It lacks penetrating power; it remains good only as some kind of siege weapon, vacumming away material from both lengths of knob. And yet, it managed to tear through that Old Man's head, and even the wall of the room that I found it in. There has to be some use for it yet, aside from the awesome power it wields of opening. My eyes wonder towards the keyhole.

Inscribed as the center bar of the "H", the keyhole is like no other I could even imagine; despite no memories of seeing any keys, they make sense. This, however, does not. The hole extends seemingly forever, patterns changing in throbbing in fractal movements that threaten to consume me from the inside out. It's nothing compared to the earlier knowledge of existence, but still enough to cause a shiver. No key could open this, nor picker thrash it. It is infinity in a keyhole, and I feel desperate to unlock it. Another reason to find the maker.

---

It's a good walking stick, all things considered. While the knob is extended, "unlocked" for lack of a better word, it feels solid enough to put weight on. Every rotation of my hand, however, threatens to send it to the groud as it rotates about and retracts the length. Infinite with no stopping power; story of my presumable life. The steps turn into kilometers as I clack on, the simple taspping of the knob being my only companion. the biggest concern I have is that, while the hours tick on by, the blur seems to increase, things becoming less real. Inside of my head lies a thought; I can fix this by just travelling through a door.

Something about that manuevreing through obscene passageways seems to stop the torque, moving me back in line with reality. If it weren't for the fear that comes close to overwhelming whenever I conswider, I would've broken right now. It feels like I'm rotating whilst stnding still, as if I'm not moving so much as turning away from the world. Everything is only slightly out of focus except my sillhoute--it;s the one thing that remains sharp to my eyes.Still, howver, it isn't too bad.

Myopeia of the soul fades from my thoughts as I continue to walk, simply ignoring the rotation. AQfter all, it's only a slight blur, and nothing I can't deal with. Especially as the light comes to a close and the stars hbegin to twirl overhead, followed by what must be the most incredible sight I've ever seen.

Above me is a moon, taking up a huge portion of the sky. It's surface is boiling, coveredm in magma from who-knows-what, and I can;'t take my eyes awsay from it. '
