When I awoke, two things immediately caught my mind. First, was the corpse--or at least I think it was, just looking at it made my head spin and stomach drop--and the doorknob it was impaled upon. I stared. On the metal doorknob, the "face" was skewered as if some hand reached down, picked up the person, and simply placed the two together. And it protruded, far out the other side of the skull in a twisty sort of way, stretching what was, for all intents and purposes, a normal doorknob into a spear-shaped haft of space, the head contorting around it to fulfil the impalement. The doorknob had a logo on it. A simple, yet stylish "H," superimposed over an exploding star. I then realized with a burst that I could read, and that I couldn't write out my name.

It wasn't that I couldn't write. The muscle memory was there, as was a faint sense that, had I tried, I could've penned a paper there and now. No, it was a burning hole in my memory where my identity and name used to lie, and I was on the brink of falling in. A noise pulled me back; the corpse and doorknob were sliding down the wall, leaving a trail of blood and crumpled steel in the motley assembly's wake. I ignored it. More important was the fact that the corpse seemed almost familiar, the visage of an Old Man visible even through the crumbled view of the face. It stared at me while I focused, trying to remember anything. Looking at the corpse made it worse; parts of my body seemed to freeze up as they seized from the cells' rebellion, the very act of staring causing my muscles to revolt. Again, though, I ignored it. More captivating was the fact that the body moved, meaning it couldn't have been here for too long, meaning I probably was involved in killing it. Whatever the fuck "it" is.

A step forward brings my face into contact with the doorknob, and the worst pain of my (albeit short) life. It feels like pulling your hand away from flypaper, caught in a trap that sucks back and nearly distorts the skin, the ligaments being the only thing preventing it from just ripping off and being obliterated by the sticky embrace. This on top of the mind-pummeling fact that the doorknob remains several meters away, and yet it feels like I've collided with a thin bar stretching both ways in front of me. If the corpse heard my screams, it didn't react. 

So I ran away, as much as a could, turning away from the grizzle and probing the room, searching carefully for a way out of this poor Man's tomb. The walls are white, devoid of anything, and the material shorn off by the doorknob's point lies white on the floor as well. Everything is sharp, yet out-of-focus, lending the world a blurry cadence that feels like it cuts into my soul and leaves me not knowing if my eyes are messed up or reality is. I brush my hand against the blur and it cuts, blades of space seeming to faintly resist the movement as my hand it overlaid on top of it. It's almost like looking at a photo; the central plane is in focus whilst everything behind and in front is messed up, distorted. The only thing that stands out, however, is that same Man and His doorknob, the two of them only existing within the confines of the central room. 

Of course, this begs the question: if I'm in some kind of featureless room with a corpse and a doorknob--what does the doorknob open? With a sigh, I decide to take the plunge and grab the doorknob, by the knob this time, and pull it from the man's face. A noise builds as a draw near, as if cell death was being amplified and blasted directly into my skull, reverberating over and over until I can't hear anything but the noise, the Old Man's radiation stripping away my very being and my flesh, boiling away as I bring the hand nearer until the very skin is dripping off, acid tabs popping as the world distorts and reality seems to converge on the corpse's face, it's hollow gaze piercing me and stabbing into my heart until

I touch the doorknob and my mind feels clearer than ever. It cuts through the din and stands out, pointing an arrow in some... other direction that leads away from this Old Man and towards an infinity of other doors just waiting to be open. Forgive me, of course, but I walk towards the nearest one. And reality shifts, and I shift, and it feels like my mind is breakijng again and it feels like the photo has gone out of focus completely and I feel like I'm sliding with no pants on and I'm falling down and up and all around and the door gets closer as I try to walk to it and fall, in a tangled heap, in front of the door with the Man somehow inside of me and yet above me at the same time
