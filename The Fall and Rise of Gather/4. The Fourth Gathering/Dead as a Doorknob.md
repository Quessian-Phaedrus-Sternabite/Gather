When I awoke, two things immediately caught my mind. First, was the corpse--or at least I think it was, just looking at it made my head spin and stomach drop--and the doorknob it was impaled upon. I stared. On the metal doorknob, the "face" was skewered as if some hand reached down, picked up the person, and simply placed the two together. And it protruded, far out the other side of the skull in a twisty sort of way, stretching what was, for all intents and purposes, a normal doorknob into a spear-shaped haft of space, the head contorting around it to fulfil the impalement. The doorknob had a logo on it. A simple, yet stylish "H," superimposed over an exploding star. I then realized with a burst that I could read, and my name was unknown.
