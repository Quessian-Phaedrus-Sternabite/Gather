*%%Body stealer who worships [[Photo Graphs|The Photographer.]] Forgot their identity, and have resorted to simply travelling as much as possible. One of the largest mass murderers. Present in [[Core Collapse]]%%*

A scream rang out through through the crowd, and nobody heard it. In the center of a clearing made not by natural patterns of walking, but by a rotted stench that lingered on the edge of awareness, a single corpse lay on the ground, its spine ripped out and discarded. She was hardly thirty, and her bones were still supple with the marrow of youth. Thrown asunder was a cup filled with a murky liquid, possibly containing dirt, or maybe just blood. The juice refused to spill out, and even in death, clung to the sides of the cup now lying on the ground. And above it all, a torn veil of flesh stared down.

Its eyesockets were bare, and most of the teeth were missing. Carved onto the forehead of its skull was an inverted star: seven points drawing inwards and converging upon a circle. They expanded, with the lines diverging ever so quickly, matching exactly the curve of the skull as to stay parallel. Blood glistened, and dripped out of the earholes in an unending river. And yet, despite this grisly sight, nobody even turned their eye towards the murder. For that's what it was--the living corpse held the spine of its victim, and seemed to be eying it with those nonexistent pockets.

It bent down, and whispers came from the mouth, solemn in their cadence. They didn't stop, visible lungs flexing and shedding off dead cells with every breath, every noise. It came as a rush, a fast prayer to something unknowable, and even as one hand cupped the distended skull on the ground, the other reached for the glass on the ground. The first hand was aflame, now, carving the same symbols into the shattered skull, and the second brought up cup to mouth. It drank, then, sharing the last drink of its victim with a green tongue, the only thing living in the entire skeleton, and even as the whispers continued, it plucks itself from the shell. Inside the former body, vines scramble and scrape away moist clods of mold from the long-dead, before stabbing into the newly departed with a vengeance. 

The body on the ground shakes, a mixture of rigor mortis and electrical impulses supplied by the vines causing it to thrash. Meanwhile, the whispers have finally concluded, the ritual done. The liquid, now coating the mouth of both victim and host, begins to burn through the bone, dissolving the last vestiges of the elder corpse. A new vessel eagerly awaits, after all.

It's been nearly an hour since it began its infiltration. The corpse has begun to cool to the point where Lycium thrive, and it finally feels at home within the boundaries of flesh. The crowd is none the wiser. At this point, the carving is complete, and the head seeps with a freshly bruised wound. The tattoos fully encircle its new body, covering it with boundless power. For the first time in nearly 5 years, it sees. 

Trish Lanheart, 33 years of age, only recently given the right to vote, deceased as of 23:12 last night, walks into a bar. She is three hours late, and very visibly dead, with her body held together by green paste and tattoos she didn't have before. Nobody minds. Her friends, very, *very* drunk, laugh, and bring her into the discussion as if she had arrived perfectly on time. Hallucinogens are passed around, great fun is had, and she retreats home in the embraces of an extraordinarily chiseled Guma, something she knows her friends will tease her for tomorrow. But her borrowed brain isn't thinking of that. Rather, it's focused on absorbing every bit of information, everything needed to clean up Trish's life and get her out into the field. For this is the first day of her second life. Her first day to finally take some photos.

*Epithet.*

*Throughout the Fourth gathering, numerous instances of Disciples were seen. They typically invoked the symbols of the Photographer, with the most extreme being granted powers beyond comprehension. They have been described as tumors in conceptual space-traitors to the rest of Gather and mindless cretins obsessed with their esteemed leader, presumed dead. Take damn good photos, however.*
