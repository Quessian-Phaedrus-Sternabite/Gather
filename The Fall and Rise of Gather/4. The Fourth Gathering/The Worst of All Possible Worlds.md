Call it a hunch. Say whatever you will about the people behind locked doors, toiling away for centuries on fuck all until the very fabric of reality begins to push against them. Talk about the ethics of their efforts, talk about how they're noble in their pursuits, talk about why I shouldn't be walking away at the first mention of c-space failing. Call it superstition. Ignore the politicians, the dreaded relics of an era we all thought lost, the people choosing to stand up in front of everyone and reassure them that, no, everything is alright, everything is ok, nobody will be impacted. And then ignore as they laugh behind their closed doors, doing nothing to stop it. Nothing to stop the failure. Nothing to stop this surge of pain. 

There were efforts, of course. People choosing to dedicate their uncertain lives towards solving these crises. Rumors of an Eighth Crèche emerged, a clandestine organization in the times when even the meaning of a crèche faded into obscurity, barricades to culture breaking down in the face of unity. In the face of Gather. But entropy always claims its victims.
