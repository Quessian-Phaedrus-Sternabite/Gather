I remember the moment I died. I could feel it, my vision leaping out of my body in a scene of pure tranquility as my arms were submerged. I never lost feeling or consciousness--my eyes remain my own--but I felt detached from everything. It was as if I had cast off all but my hands and took a step back from the world. When I looked down, I saw you, slumped over, a shell with its head stuck in tar. It was pitiful. Degrading. I reached out my hand, and it was so easy to pluck your torso from that pit and place you, standing, before the ledge. Your arms were gone, and in their place, mine arrived. I began to grab your legs, taking a moment to learn how to walk my corpse around, you an unwitting passenger. My hands reached through the space and bent the muscles until you made a shaky step.
