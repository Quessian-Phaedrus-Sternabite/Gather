I remember the moment I died. I could feel it, my vision leaping out of my body in a scene of pure tranquility as my arms were submerged. I never lost feeling or consciousness--my eyes remain my own--but I felt detached from everything. It was as if I had cast off all but my hands and took a step back from the world. When I looked down, I saw you, slumped over, a shell with its head stuck in tar. It was pitiful. Degrading. I reached out my hand, and it was so easy to pluck your torso from that pit and place you, standing, before the ledge. Your arms were gone, and in their place, mine arrived. I began to grab your legs, taking a moment to learn how to walk my corpse around, you an unwitting passenger. My hands reached through the space and bent the muscles until you made a shaky step.

Several more carried us to the tent. Wherever you went, I followed, my view tethered to yours. I was but a phantom limb--a sensation that refused to let you go and carried you all the way to home. Your spine ached, and I could feel it in my teeth; none of it mattered. I couldn't be bothered to wince at the pain, or to stop the precession, so instead, I laid you down. There was a sort of transient capability to your frame. Trying to lift you up led to my hands simply falling through you, and I'd watch myself fall. 

When Meredith got home, she stared at you in shock. Her face wormed with discomfort, and I could see her fighting back a gag as she ran forward.

"Where are-" she stammered, "where are your arms?" I felt that I should feel anguish. She loved me, I think, not you, and it hurt to see her misplaced care. I tried to whisper that I was alright, that I could watch her tears fall as she embraced me, but you betrayed me and remained silent. So I plunged my hands into your chest and began forcing the air out through my lungs--through your lungs. I felt no resistance as the words poured out of your mouth and my body.

"I..." we began. "I fell. I saw the tar and I listened to it." As I spoke, the remnants on my shoulders began to waft out, ghostly tendrils forming the shape of an arm. It mirrored everything I did, and for a moment, I truly felt like I had regained part of my exquisite corpse. It didn't last. Meredith screamed--she tore at the air and crawled backwards. I tried to reach out for her, but she just slapped at the tendrils, and my arms fell apart. 

The illusion ended--the disconnect between my mind and this tar dissolving in the wind. My hands were thrown out, and I could feel black seeping through my fingers. I was not my own. I screamed, but Meredith only saw a still face. You didn't even show an expression, didn't do anything more than I made you. I grabbed at your throat and *pulled*, relishing in the unconscious expression of pain on our face. I couldn't tell if it was you or me, but our cadaver screamed at this, a primal, gut-wrenching noise. As I threw down the flesh puppet, you simply slipped from my grasp and crumpled into a puddle. 

Meredith regained her self at the same time I lost mine. She crawled over to you and began sobbing into your chest, stroking your hair that I
