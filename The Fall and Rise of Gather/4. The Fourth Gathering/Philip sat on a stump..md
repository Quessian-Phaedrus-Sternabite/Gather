The first amongst his family, Novus Nayef The Wind Propelling the Strings of Various Phillips - known as Phillip to his friends and Novus Nayef Phillips to those his family would rather he not associate with - decided against pursuing the business of engineering, for within his life he found a more pure pursuit of theoretical mathematics; to him, it felt as if he could visualize the tapestry of the world whilst holding a bottle of dye, unable to affect it precisely, but if he tried with all of his capability, he could make a splash of color: unfortunately, this colorful attitude serviced him only with disappointment as time and time again he was rejected from jobs due to heritage, as was custom in the earlier days of the Fourth Gathering; after the latest in a job rejection, and the harshest of disappointments thus far, Phillips sat on a stump in quiet solitude and overlooked the city of his birth, Umval, home to a population demographic consisting of a relatively solid and remarkably consistent mixtures of the various Cr√®chelings, before debating on his life's pursuit, another newfangled custom since conceptual space was discovered; it involved devoting one's life to focus entirely on a single intense action, movement, or philosophy; Phillips' parents had decided 'gainst it, choosing instead to multitask and focus on the lesser part of conceptuality by merely making a name for themselves, but for Phillips, recognition wasn't enough: he had to be more, to seek more, to *do* something more with his life than be a faceless engineer in a society where less and less traditionalists persisted (granted, of course, this made engineers more valuable, despite the clashing cultures arising from the vast spread of civilizations, forcing companies and individuals to increasingly deal with and navigate around the needs of many), so instead, as he sat on the stump, he contemplated the very idea of abstract mathematics, and what it meant to fully engross oneself in an idea; oddly enough, he became engrossed in the idea of engrossment, as many before him as done, and he stopped moving from the stump entirely- in the days of pilgrimage that many youths with newfound immortality abused to their fullest extent, it was tradition, of course, to share a belonging with an interesting person you meet, assuming of course that they told you a story or tale of their life, and so it came that interesting people were revered and taken care of in order to continue whatever their pursuits may be- in Phillips case, as he sat on his stump and concentrated on the deep mysteries of meaning the universe had to offer, he was sustained by virtue of a large youth concentration from Umval itself, as many sought solemnity in solitude as he had himself; his parents never came looking, for they, as many others, believed he requested time for himself in his disappearance to think and contemplate, and besides, time was all they had; so as it was, Phillips continued to sit and wonder about what it was he could do with his life, a very unfortunate choice indeed: in that time, when concepts were raw, one could have instead chosen to become eponymous with power, or cutting, or anything of import that sounds "cool" enough, but by virtue of his walkabout turned sit-about a stump, Phillips was pushed to conform in the box of "Sage," and despite him even debating resisting, he found the more people thought of him as a wise sage on a stump not too far from a nearby hub of civilization, the easier it was to be one, and the more he fell down this rabbit-hole of "enlightenment," the more content he felt, until eventually, he found that his stump had rotted away and he instead sat on carved stone, the hillside having expanded into a temple where he could be seen, his quips of advice being turned into parables or proverbs spoken by many, and he found that though he strayed into dreaded philosophy, Phillips was happy with his gift of discernment.
