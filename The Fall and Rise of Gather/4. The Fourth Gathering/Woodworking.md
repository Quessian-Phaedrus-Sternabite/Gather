When he was a young man, Lutfi[^1] had decided to take up woodworking. Many of his friends laughed at him, with the exception of his father. Novus Rashid Mahdi had always been a proud man, a beacon of the community who supported his family no matter what. He tempered his ambition, and worked it with a flame to instill the life he wanted upon his children, ensuring they would be brought up well. When he heard of Lutfi's dreams one night, if a dream it could be called, he merely chuckled and asked what wood he should buy. It was as such that Lutfi began to swap his pencils and pens for a chisel and mallet.
At the tender age of 19, Lutfi was still considered a child by many of the inhabitants of his sector of Dyson Station 01, and this newfound passion was seen as reassurance by the community aboard the creaking outpost. It was clear that woodworking would be merely a trifle, as the only market nowadays was luxury goods, of which certainly *no one* aboard an old station such as this would be affording anytime soon. Nevertheless, Lutfi didn't relent, and he began making his first creations with the shipment of wood his father purchased for him as an extremely late birthday present. 
Lutfi's first creations were a disaster. Despite devoting his every action to precision, he found that his trembling hands seemed to move across the wood in the opposite ways that he wanted. It brought him all but rage, and he would've quit if it wasn't for his father's insistence he continue. Besides, Lutfi thought, he already purchased the wood. It would be a waste if he gave up. So continue he did, and great progress was made. Within a year, he successfully carved a mug, which a neighbor, upon seeing the lovely work, decided to purchase from him for a few dinar.
