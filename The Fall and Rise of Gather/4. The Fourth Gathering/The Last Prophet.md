Miriam sat down and stared ahead, her eyes open yet unseeing. In front of her, waves crashed against the cliffside, carving out channels of rock and lifting pebbles away into the infinite dark. All of this happened around her, and none of it mattered. Inside her mind were strands, millions, no, billions of them, all connected, all weaving into a tapestry of fate. Each strand bore a name--a distant connection to who-knows-where--a person waiting for something to finally happen to them and change their fate-stricken life. It was desolate in Miriam's mind, unchanging and cruel, and it was just how she liked it.

The pain had yet to fade; a searing network of cabled scars crossed her chest and bore a sigil into her flesh that connected her to the beyond. It was but the first step along her journey. When she was younger, no less than a few hundred years old, she was one of the first to bear witness to the Dullahan in all his glory. She had been sitting on a park bench, watching birds go by, when everything seemed to freeze. The birds began moving, arranging themselves in an arcane form without flapping a feather. It was one of the most beautiful things she had ever seen.

Miriam was no stranger to the conceptual, being one of the first generations to make it to the triple-digits, but this feat was beyond her. To reach out and caress reality without a single soul noticing? It was unparalleled. So she watched, and she focused, and while everyone around her was frozen without even noticing, she caught a glimpse. There were thousands of them, hands in every color and size, reaching out from beyond and fixing the scene. A sphere stared back at her, looking decidedly unhuman as it beheld her glance. She could feel more of the hands on her body, posturing and posing her as she sat without more than a whisper of noise. Even that was only imagined, and as she stared, the silence stared back. 

One of the hands began adjusting her face, and had she been able to cry, sobs would've filled the air. True beauty befell her, the hand cemented in her vision with seven fingers splayed equidistant around an aperture--a tube of pure darkness that reached out to her mind and embraced it. She desperately threw all of her focus at understanding the glory she saw, and felt something call back to her. In her mind's eye lied a series of strings, connected at numerous points until a heptagram presented itself to her; a fragment of the true Photographer, the symbol still evoked a fraction of the fear felt by His present. So she embraced it. Even after the photo was taken, even after everyone around her began to move, she stayed frozen. Miriam cradled the image in her head, and chose to listen to the calling.

On the eve of the next day, one of her friends would stumble upon Miriam, sitting in a bathtub covered in blood. On her torso and across her back stretched that asterisk of fate, lines wrapping around and meeting again in impossible ways. At the center laid a chunk of the True Eye, a shallow vestige of His that still contained its power. The friend collapsed at the sight, dying within minutes as she failed to comprehend what she saw. Miriam was none the wiser, and when she woke, she cast off her humanity and left the planet to contemplate what she had become.

Over 1,000 years had passed. Her body was timeless, and Miriam was immune to the ravages of time. The skin around the carvings had become old and faded, alternating between fresh blood seeping from cracks and ancient scars that seemed nothing more than a memory of the pain she had endured. With the scars came a gift from his repertoire--a chunk of the True Sight that gave Him access to the secrets of the universe. From a young age, Miriam had always focused on the nature of the future, and it was this form which her gift took. Where He witnessed concepts as they
