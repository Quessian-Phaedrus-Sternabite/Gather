%%*Story about an expedition into a planet made up entirely of a labyrinthian monastery, revealed to be the ruins of Roth, the home of Noelle Cathan growing up. Absolutely gigantic, and hidden chambers are found, as well as someone who stayed alive in a stasis. Do note: Rhyne becomes one of the largest sources of sheer power as the monks have their dreams realized*%%

Rhyne Expedition Log 1

Date: Year 2730 of the 4th Gathering
Members: Rhyne Scouts A-G
Brief: Rhyne, a planet located roughly 200 light-years from Earth is rumored to be the original home planet of Noelle Cathan, the founder of Cathan and original member of Gather. As a result, extra care must be taken to ensure safe containment of any artefacts left from the First Gathering. A team consisting of one member from each crèche was formed to investigate in an effort to increase crèche cohesion into Gather.

[Scout A]: Entering "prime" entrance, hereby designated as the prime meridian, Latitude 38 degrees North.
[Scout C]: Door breached.
[Scout D]: Connecting lights to external power source.
*Scout B trips over the stony ground as they set up the generator.*
[A]: Everything alright?
[Scout B]: Yeah. The generator is primed.
[A]: Proceed into the labyrinth.

*Footsteps are heard as they walk into the labyrinth covering the planets surface*
[Scout F]: The fuck?
[A]: Please refrain from swearing during the expedition.
[F]: Sorry, just, does anyone feel that?
[Scout G]: I feel it too.
[A]: For the record- there is an outwards pull that grows in strength proportional to the speed of movement. Move slowly everyone.

*A gunshot is heard as Scout G shoots a conventional thrasher, followed by screams from the group as a minor explosion rings out*

[A]: STAND DOWN! Do not fire! 
[C]: What the fuck is wrong with you?!
[G]: *Screams*
[B]: I'm hit!
[D]: *Sobs with an arm held close to their chest.*

*Pieces of shrapnel, appearing to be parts of the thorn, are lodged in Scout D's arm and Scout B's leg despite the two being directly adjacent to Scout F*

*The expedition retreats on suspicions of a hostile active suppresion field being in place*

Rhyne Expedition Log 2

Date: Year 2730 of the 4th Gathering
Members: Second Division of Rhyne Scouts A-G
Brief: Examinations of Rhyne show presence of distorted space, expected to be hyperbolic based on patterns. The degree of distortion is unknown, as well as how it fluctuates throughout, but speeds must be kept low to ensure cohesion. In addition, mapping software has been updated to ensure proper consideration for the extra space. The structure may be anywhere from two to ten times the size of the planet. All weapons were removed that involved high speed.

[Scout A]: This is Scout A with the Second Division, we have reached the prime entrance. 
[Scout B]: The generator is still here.
[Scout C]: Each person should carry a tethered light to ensure lighting and adequate backtracking.

*Lights are handed out.*

[Scout G]: We should be clear to proceed.
[A]: Got it. I'll be taking point.
[Scout D]: I'll follow.

*The group proceeds into the labyrinth.*

[Scout E]: That's odd, it's still bright in here.
[Scout F]: Yeah, looks like bloom almost.
[A]: B, go check out that statue.
[B]: Gotcha.

[C to F, aside]: Have you ever seen any stone like that?
[F]: Now's not the time.

[B]: Statue seems to be extraordinarily dense, with immaculate, if rudimentary sculpting. 
[A]: Noted. Let's move on
[G]: Which way?
[C]: I say we stick to the left. Classic maze-solving procedure.
[F]: It's hyperbolic. 5 or more lefts to come back to the start and whatnot.
[C]: And? Still remains the same.
[A]: Let's go with C's suggestion.

*The hallway opens up into a room, abut 70 by 70 meters with a 20 meter tall roof, exposed to bloom.*

[C]: Dear Jask that's big. 
[F]: Where's that light coming from? The labyrinth was completely sealed from outside, and it matches the system's star perfectly.

*Later spectroscopy corraborated this*

[A]: Recorded. Anyone get photos?
[G]: Yup.
[A]: Good. Continue through the left most entrance.

... 
The next 2 hours of audio continued as such, with the distortions notably getting more intense as altitude decreases. Bloom continues to be present despite the depth, and the tunnels begin to get more complex. 
...

[D]: I can't take this anymore.
[E]: I agree. This is unbearable
[F]: I tripped earlier and just whirling my arm made it swell up a bit.
[A]: Got it. I'll request permission to leave.
[G]: Has anyone noticed the architecture getting more detailed?
[B]: Yeah, it's starting to get kinda creepy. Look at this statue.

*Scout B reaches up to brush dust off the statue and pushes the arm, causing a large section of the wall to recede back.*

[A]: Woah! Stand back.
[C]: *a small scream*
[B]: Sorry! Didn't mean to.
[F]: Hey, look inside.

*Behind the wall is a passage stretching up and around the rooms*
