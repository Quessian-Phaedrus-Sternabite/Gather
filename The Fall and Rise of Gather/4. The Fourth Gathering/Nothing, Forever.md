## Act 1
### Scene 1
*[Enter two men, an ancient one covered in dirt with ragged clothes and a beard and another, clean-shaven and dressed in a suit]*
[Young Man]: -AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
[Old Man]: Finally! I thought you would never shut up.
[Young Man]: Nonononononononnonon-
[Old Man]: Of course.
[Young Man]: Where am I‽ Who are you‽ Who am I‽‽ What is this place‽‽‽
[Old Man]: Just please, be quiet!!
[Young Man]: How can I be quiet when I don't even remember my na-
*[The older man pulls out a thin shaft and hits the younger man in the head.]*
*[Exit Old Man.]*
*[Enter Old Man, from the other side of the stage.]*
[Old Man]: Wake up, you twat!
[Young Man]: Oh... My head is killing me...
[Old Man]: Shame I didn't hit harder.
[Young Man]: You hit me??
[Old Man]: Is it not obvious?
[Young Man]: What was the precedent‽‽‽
[Old Man]: Terrible question.
[Young Man]: What?
[Old Man]: Another one!
[Young Man]: Don't yell!
[Old Man]: Well well, look who's talking now.
[Young Man]: I just... don't understand what any of this is.
[Old Man]: Welcome to life! Would you like some tea?
[Young Man]: Where do you even get tea‽ There's nothing here.
[Old Man]: That's like asking where a horse gets its milk.
[Young Man]: What the fuck is a horse‽‽‽
[Old Man]: Bah! Youth these days, never appreciating the lack of luster.
[Young Man]: Please, I'm begging you, explain.
[Old Man]: Again with the poor questions!
[Young Man]: Surely you can't be serious.
[Old Man]: Why not?
[Young Man]: Aha! Poor question.
*[The Old Man slaps the younger one]*
[Young Man]: Hey!
[Old Man]: Don't go off stealing my lines!
[Young Man]: Fuck you!
[Old Man]: And watch your language!
*[Every light turns off and the stage cuts to black. Voices trail off as the two argue.*]

### Scene 2
*[Lights come back on, with the stage empty]*
*[Enter the two men, still arguing, from the left*]
[Young Man]: Enough!
[Old Man]: That's new.
[Young Man]: I'm not questing, just begging. Please, explain.
[Old Man]: Why should I?
[Young Man]: For explanation's sake?
[Old Man]: When is that ever a good reason?
[Young Man]: So let me get this straight. You never do anything for curiosity's sake?
[Old Man]: Poor question, but you're learning.
[Young Man]: That wasn't an answer.
[Old Man]: And that's not a question.
[Young Man]: We can't just sit here forever, arguing to no end! Surely, you have to answer!
[Old Man]: Why?
[Young Man]: Out of the kindness of your heart‽ I don't know!
[Old Man]: Not that, moron, I meant why can't we sit here forever?
[Young Man]: Well, because we'll... we'll...
*[The younger man trails off]*
[Old Man]: We'll what?
[Young Man]: I can't remember...
[Old Man]: Can't remember, or is it something so insignificant that you don't need to remember.
[Young Man]: No- it's like this burning inkling of a truth that I know, in my heart, is real, but I can't quite place a name to it.
[Old Man]: Shame. What were we talking about again?
[Young Man]: You're just going to brush this off‽
[Old Man]: I don't see why you're so concerned. 
[Young Man]: This feels like it's central to my being! Like there's something at the tip of my tongue!
[Old Man]: Then we'll have to cut it off.
[Young Man]: What?
[Old Man]: The tongue, you moron.
*[A sword is pulled from the air itself, it's blade as white as the void]*
[Young Man]: No! Why would you-
[Old Man]: Don't you dare finish that question.
[Young Man]: ...do such a thing?
[Old Man]: That's it. Time out.
*[Exit old man through a trapdoor]*
[Young Man]: Wait! Come back! I'm sorry!
*[Nothing happens]*
[Young Man]: Well, at least I have my tongue.
*[Lights off]*
[Narrator]: One year passes.

## Act 2
### Scene 1
*[Enter Old Man and Young Man]*
[Young Man]: IT'S YOU!
*[He charges at the old man. Notably, both look identical to their previous states]*
*[The old man dodges and slices the younger mans Achilles tendon]*
[Young Man]: I thought I went insane! You left me here for so long!
[Old Man]: And again with the whining! When will you learn your lesson!
[Young Man]: Wait, please! I'm sorry, I'll do anything to avoid being alone!
[Old Man]: Good. Have you thought about what you did?
[Young Man]: Is there anything else to do in this eldritch nightmare‽
[Old Man]: Finally, a good question!
[Young Man]: Why is that good‽
[Old Man]: You'll find out. That's one, by the way.
[Young Man]: One what‽‽
[Old Man]: Question. Two.
[Young Man]: Oh. Okay. I think I understand.
[Old Man]: Do you?
[Young Man]: How long have you been here?
[Old Man]: You're lucky that you've got a question left.
[Young Man]: That's not an answer.
[Old Man]: Losing count at 78,000 is.
[Young Man]: Seventy-eight thousand what? Hours, Days, Weeks?
[Old Man]: Oh come on! Shouldn't that be obvious!
[Young Man]: Come to think of it... I shouldn't be fine.
[Old Man]: Oh?
[Young Man]: When I think about it, why do I feel nothing from having my ankles destroyed?
[Old Man]: You're really asking that now?
[Young Man]: Oh shut up, it was rhetorical.
[Old Man]: Are you going to sit around and moan about your feet or are we going to get to talking?
[Young Man]: Why am I here?
[Old Man]: Can you even hear me?
[Young Man]: Unless.
[Old Man]: Not again...
[Young Man]: Are you real?
*[Silence]*
[Young Man]: You're not even going to critique the question?
*[The silence continues, before the old man sighs.]*
[Young Man]: I think I know the answer.
[Old Man]: I should've cut off you tongue.
*[He begins walking in circles around the stage, and the young man follows]*
[Young Man]: I believe I've thought of the right question.
[Old Man]: I'm listening.
[Young Man]: It's not about how long you've been here. It's about how long I've been here.
[Old Man]: Yo-
[Young Man]: Don't answer. I think I've got it. You can leave, now.
[Old Man]: Are you sure?
[Young Man]: I think so.
*[The Old Man again disappears, and the younger proceeds to sit on a part of the void*]
