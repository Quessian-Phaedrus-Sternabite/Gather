%%*A parable about wisdom through ignorance. Aevum Lauren Walks Through a Clouded Mind should be a minor character, though perhaps have her show up in other legends as a character meant to dissuade someone or show them they're over-complicating things. Also, pretty much none of this is accurate.*%%
In the times when names had meaning, and gods walked amongst men, there was one woman in particular who forged her path against all odds. Her name was Lauren. More accurately, it was Aevum Lauren Walks Through a Clouded Mind, but she wasn't very uptight. She was born on Elysium, one of the 12 grand capitals the Aevuternites found dominion over. As such, she had hair so pale it was almost white, and a deep olive complexion that seemed to glow in its radiance. She was quite tall and lithe, at an astounding 6'1", higher than many Aevuternites within a 50 kilometer radius of her birth. Her parents were very traditional in their ways, and ensured she was born in the vacuum of space, following a geosynchronous orbit directly above her planned childhood home. Whether due to that or some other means, Lauren was known almost entirely for one thing: her luck. It seemed that no small amount of fortune was her companion, as she saw great success in school, life, and her pursuits of anything she wanted. Despite this, she was an absolute, total, incomprehensibly oblivious fool. Despite the world on her string, she was humble to a fault, citing ambition as a source of immorality in the world. She cared deeply about her precious "goodness," and suffered great distress whenever it was violated. It was said that 200 young suitors had voluntarily turned themselves to stone after one made her cry with a particularly lewd comment. 
It came about that through her aging, Lauren maintained the sort of innocence most parents hope their children pretend to have. With every year that added itself to her expectedly long lifespan, her friends and family grew concerned in her total lack of anything approaching common sense. So intense their worry grew that they decided to send her off to see three teachers, revered through the lands for the immense dedication and focus. 

After bidding her family goodbye, Lauren left Elysium, and made towards Sooth, where the first teacher dwelled. A man of great renown, Aevum the Silent Wake of the Law, or Law to those who were closet to him, had so shaped his identity through his time on the Supreme Court of Gather than he became synonymous with the law itself. Surely, Lauren's community thought, he could educate a bright pupil such as herself. When she arrived, her very introduction with him was enough to make the rounds around the entire city of his residence.
"Good evening Aevum Lauren Walks Through a Clouded Mind." Law intoned. "You may know me as Aevum the Silent Wake of the Law, as was my phrasal name adopted in the 120th year of immortality when reality itself was breached, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Gather, the founder of the great planet Licit, and the Unity of Aevum." Lauren of course only answered him with a blank look, before deciding her response.
"Afternoon Law!" It was perhaps the first lashing she had received in her life. Regardless, Law began instructing her in the law, imparting knowledge on to her impressionable young mind in a display not seen for over a millennia since Law was the master to a young Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, 30 or so generations removed from his current pupil. Certainly, the onlookers thought, this must work. For everyone who was anyone in the realms of Aevum at that time had heard of Lauren, and her Name had become most renowned despite her young stature. For that reason, but not that alone, she was all the more stubborn in her fecklessness. Law was obsessed with loopholes, as any self-respecting Aevuternite was, and so it drove him mad to see Lauren's cavalier outlook upon the great legal systems that governed Gather.
"Lauren, I would like you to deliver twelve ounces of Sharp to the address here," Law told her one day, giving Lauren a slip of paper with instructions of pickup.
"I've got it!" Lauren cried out, "It's a test! Despite me not purchasing any, possession of Sharp is strictly against the law."
With a harsh sigh, Law slapped Lauren across the face, which she ignored; it was only a half-liter of blood after all. After the dogs had finished licking it up from the scorched stone where it fell, she latched her eyes onto her mentor's face. 
"You moron." Law said, before walking away. "You have a skintight legal defense. Due to the area being a protected commercial zone for imports and exports, there's no legal ground for conviction, scilicet, they lose all pretense of arrest if you have ambassadorial status. Such a thing would be easy to claim, and even assuming they do search you, there's only flimsy grounds for a warrant, forcing their evidence's invalidity."
"But master," Lauren questioned, "it's still illegal even if you aren't convicted, right?"
Law had failed her. Without another word, he wrote off the 30 years of training and decided that Lauren was past redemption. The sheer lack of ambition in her was more than he could overcome. With an extraordinarily light heart, he exiled her from his home and bid her to never come back. 
After a tearful (and one-sided) farewell from Lauren, as well as promises to visit, she continued unto the next great teacher for which her parents had arranged parlay.

Thankfully, there were only four casualties during the trip, and Lauren made it safely (minus a finger) to the moon Thunnus, named for it's lovely fish. For of all things, Lauren's next teacher was said to be the greatest fisherman alive. Her mind would become more still than the very waters she fished in, and many would come watch as she systemically emptied the oceans. Of course, Fidelis Twelve Second Percussion Solo hated being disturbed, and would throw a hook through anyone who so much as breathed to use them as bait for her repeated casting. Lauren, predictably, was sent under the depths to be fish food dozens of times in the first day. Every time a creature would come curiously to investigate, she merely greeted it happily; the very thought of it wanting to harm her never crossed her mind. The fish, of course, didn't care what she thought, but they gave her a wide berth due to her awkwardness. Eventually, Perc got so fed up with Lauren's refusal to die that she told her to meditate underwater for 27 hours straight (the length of a Thunnusian day). Lauren, of course, obeyed with a fervor Perc had never seen from anyone, and came up 27 hours later. Many of the onlookers witnessed this astonishing feat, and several cut the soles of their feet off in an act of worship; Lauren simply asked them to put them back on, and turned back to Perc with anticipation. Finally, after the ordeal of a week she put Lauren through, Perc agreed to teach her. 
Lauren's training started with fishing, since that was Perc's specialty. When Lauren sent her line down into the depths of the ocean from a small platform constructed for that purpose, it took less than a second for a fish to bite. Lauren, being extraordinarily lucky, managed to reel in a 17 meter gigabass the likes of which had never been seen in recorded history. So it was that Perc was lynched, and every one of her watcher's went to witness more of Lauren's feats. Until, of course, with a pleasant grin, Lauren threw the bass back into the waters. Even the mourning calls of the spectators couldn't stop her from babbling at her master.
"I did it!" Lauren said, exuberantly. "I caught one. Do I keep going?" 
"Fool!" Perc shouted, hobbling over whilst yelling nonstop, "do you realize what you've done?" Perhaps the greatest accomplishment a fisher could hope to make had been released into the ocean, and Perc couldn't fathom why.
"Is it not cruel to kill living creatures for sport? Is that what the Founder intended when they sent us off to establish empire?" Lauren's words quested.
Perc barked out a vicious laugh, "No you idiot!" After beating Lauren with her fishing pole, which she had been using as a cane from the lynching,
