%%Dullahan - Irish headless horseman. Main character, the photographer, removed his own head to replace it with a four-dimensional camera.%%

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

A scrape rang out through the room, piercing the veil of silence surrounding... me. My frown turns over, the trembling grimace becoming a shaky smile while the knife finishes its traversal. On the end, curls of metal fall to the ground, no longer supported by anything. I can't help but feel a sculptor, my chisel shaping metal organs whilst my predecessors 
scraped stone.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Bone has a similar texture to hot metal, if you're familiar with it. It's like a chalky stone, until you get to the marrow. Channels can be drawn into it, either with a carving blade or acid. Regardless, the metal flows through just the same.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

It clogs my veins. On the floor, piles of skin and liters of blood pool around him, clumping up in sickly-sweet piles that threaten to send me slipping across the floor with any steps taken. Metal binds it together, molten steel dripping steadily from my beheld crucible. It pours out in waves, filling the channels, burning the skin, emulsifying my humanity.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

It's funny to consider. I've become numb to my own screams. Air sounds funny when you have no throat for it to become amplified. My vocal cords lay pried open, the folds of my throat exposed to open air by grilles carved into flesh. I'm peeled like a flower, petals of sinew arranged in a lovingly crafted display.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

My arm quivers as I struggle to hold it up. A ballpoint pen is the closest comparison, it's channels digging through the core and the steel penetrating the marrow, burning my blood cells from the inside out. The paring dagger never wavers, my deft fingers moving across my skin as fast as I can manage as they transform the lumpy metal into smooth, sleek precision. It's a work of art.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Nothing but willpower keeps my body moving. For years, I had been an apostle of the greats. Cartheradge himself, that great scholar of the Third Gathering, had been my closest companion, his treatises on light guiding me through my own pits of darkness. His photos struck me to my very core, impacting my life in ways nothing else had.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

I was always in motion. Never stopping, never waiting around. And yet, within that rush, tranquility. To capture images was to be still, waiting for the right lineup of light and movement that leads to an imperceptible twitch of the index finger, limbs stopped over a tripod or a rock or anything to stabilize you, explosive movement to the next location in a short time. Thousands of kilometers, millions of steps had been walked, my struggling heart barely sufficient to supply blood to my beleaguered muscles. 

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Concepts were fickle things. They needed focus, intense reflection of your goals as you devote every action of your life towards association. Another strip of flesh is peeled away, another sliver added to the growing pile. Wires wrap around the limb before coalescing into a point just below my collarbone. Nothing is there, yet, but I'm ready. More metal is poured onto the arms, converting my left arm into a technological wonder.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Analogue machinery was laid into my very bones, terminus at the wrist and the only flesh left, my hand, was soon to be subsumed. This was to be the hardest part. Any mistake, trembling, or waver in my focus would lead to a crippled left arm and a ruined right. What other option is there?

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

I tried to be motion incarnate. Photography was a dead art, it's practitioners having perished sometime during the start of the Fourth. 3-dimensional holography took over, lenses offset through space in that peculiar direction nobody could perceive. Nobody cared about optical "imperfections" that had so haunted artists of the past. It died. And now, I would too.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Another scrape took with it the muscles connecting my thumb to the rest of my hand. The loose bundle of bones hung limply, but I ignored it in favor of the other fingers. A single swipe of the scalpel was enough to split the cords and webbing between the digits; they flapped apart with unrivaled flexibility. The muscles had to be slowly pried from the embrace of the skeleton, hanging on as the cells' lives depended on it. They did, of course. But sacrifices must be made for the greater good: me, in this case.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Cartheradge was killed some thirty-odd years into the fighting. He was a combat photographer to a bitter end, choosing to deliver the galaxy beautifully crafted shots that inked out the desperation and tragedy of war. His death was a turning point for photography, with no masters even remotely close to his level emerging since. Of course, the art persisted, Ange and Medinilla following after strife and Putrescence cooled down, their families and lives abandoned in pursuit of the truth. Their books and photos adorned my walls. 

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

My resolve loosens. A guttural thrash whispers from my throat, the clicking and groaning of tissue filled with holes and drained of air, blood pooling down my chest and onto my metallic arm with it's joints eroded away by the flames of forgery. My hand is gone, at this point, with the fingers left being shaped by my right. Each section is slowly being lengthened, the segments extending and being connected with ductile metal, joints prepared specifically for this perfection. The first knuckle comes off, thrown to the ground with the rest of my useless organs, and I quickly replace it with the artifice. I know that I need to keep going, but, not for the first time, I debate stopping to cope with the pain. It fills me, causing that whooshing of air to intensify as I empty my lungs and bladders over and over with unconscious seizing. The second knuckle is gone. The stretching embrace of my right hand crawls along the ground, grabbing with it a shard of ulna. It falls to my blade, being whittled down into the approximate shape of another finger, and another, and even more until I'm left with eight or nine extra stretches of bone to graft with my hand. You can never have enough reach, or fingers.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

70 years after the discovery of conceptual space came the first true holographic camera. It was a miracle; it was an abomination of nature. A *camra* pierces into the space and tears backwards, its meager 20 or so centimeters standing out like a pimple, bursting at the seams with acidic pus, prodding into whoever drew near in an indistinguishable sense of *wrongness*. But they adapted. By the 1400th year of our Forth Gathering, holography was perfected. 

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

My hand brings me back to this world of the damned. My index finger lays in front of me like a rope, 7 joints extending it forward more than 20 centimeters. It flexes from in front of my eyes, my willpower coiling within and cementing that, yes, this is a part of *me*, this deserves my *movement*. It's fluid, metal bending and dancing before my eyes, and I waste no time at all in using the serrated edge of one of the joints to saw at another finger, cannibalizing one with its better. Muscles fall down as the awing continues-a guttural wrench of skin from bone. Meanwhile, my right hand acts with a mind of its own, carving a hole in my palm large enough for a standard 30mm tube to fit through. My ulna is gone, my radius liquified, and there's just enough room in the hardened metal for the tube to carve out a hole for itself. At the bottom lies a simple light sensor.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Nobody realized the consequences until it was too late. For the longest time, camrae were just associated with an unpleasant tingling, a feeling at the base of your spine or neck that crawled up in niggling waves, nothing too unpleasant but rather jus annoying. Dulcium was rooted in the tubes and mounts of the devices, the only element yet found to naturally exist in a fourth-dimensional state. It rooted things, allowed us to manipulate stuff to and fro. One direction provided an insurmountable resistance. So they plotted




it out. The fourth dimension extends "up" and "down" for a likely infinite distance, and 



we are located near the bottom. 17 millimeters away, to be precise. To go down brings us


to the border, the area where reality gives way to concepts. We were never meant to

go there. "Above" us was stretched space, exponentially growing away from our plane of reality. We used to be uncoupled from conceptual space, but Veritas fucked it all up.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Two of seven fingers were complete. Another bone had been sacrificed, this time to create a mold. Solid steel weighed infinitely more than calcium or cartilage, its sturdy bite making up for the heft with cutting power, the chromium and tungsten forged along making it truly stainless. My first two tendrils were meant to be dexterous, flexible in all the ways necessary for precise movements. The other five, with two grafted on for good measure, would form a heptagram on my palm centered on the camera, pulling its focusing tube in and out of my flesh become metal as needed, swapping lenses and everything else needed to make a truly modular system.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

The perfect way to get a holograph of the baseline was to situate a camra perfectly "above" it and take a photo looking "down." Conveniently, that means an out of focus one will show an image of Conceptual Space in all its mind-melting glory. Usually, it's edited out, but the data is still there. Of course, when people discovered that their secrets and connections could be laid bare with every broadcast, combined with the increasingly disgusting effect camrae had on their consciousnesses, there was a near unanimous consent by the Cr√®ches to ban them until a solution was found. I was that solution. 

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

Finally, my hand was complete. My right arm began to be shucked, shedding the skin and snapping into pieces. Each finger wrapped around it, peeling my arm layer by layer like an rotted baked potato. There was no need to be precise, especially with the bone being just a base for the true arm; the sizzling of leftover meat was music to my pureed ears, at east through bone conduction. My elbow was another weakness, a joint that clicked and clacked far too much for my liking, so it was dissolved like the rest, acid pouring in to polish the metal and prepare a slot for the new flexor. It slid into the still warm smelt, another few swipes of the blade helping chisel the muscles of my new arm accordingly. With enough time and patience, life itself was yet another illusion I could replicate.

*Shhhhhhhhhck*

While my right arm was being rebirthed, I
