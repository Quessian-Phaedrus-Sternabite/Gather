Ladies, Gentlemen, Lycium-folk[^1] and more! You've no doubt wondered about this newfangled "conceptual space" that's been all over the news, and I'm here to reveal all! 

### What is Conceptual Space?
I'm so glad you ask! Directly adjacent to our universe is another, nearly identical in all ways but one. You see, over there, every concept present in all of existence is represented as a (most likely) physical object! These concepts are linked together by ethereal connections, at least according to our understanding! After the events of Project Veritas-062 ([[Screams]]), we managed to make two vital connections! The first was tying together Conceptual Space to reality, which had the effect of allowing reality to affect CS and vice-versa! The other was to connect the very idea of our beloved Gather to Reality, offering us extraordinary benefits[^2]! Since then, our wise scientists, ethicists, and eschatologists have decided to not make any more of these connections, leaving the rest up to us! In conceptual space, there are two ways to connect two concepts. The first is with a large amount of weak connections. Generally, any time you hear about a person able to "make arrows obey their beck and call" are really just charismatic, and friendly to the arrows[^3]. Alternatively, a person can devote a large amount of time to forming a single, extraordinary strong connection, allowing them to (in extreme cases) become the physical embodiment of a concept[^4]! 

## How can *I* make a connection?
Get to know your concept! Focus on how you perceive yourself being enmeshed in yourself. Remember this easy mantra: "I *am* [concept]. [Concept] is who I am"

[^4]: Note: The more broad a concept is, the harder it can be to form a strong connection. Focus on specific ideas, such as "making latté art in dimly lit cafés."
