Your head lies in shattered pieces, each memory a stab to the brain. In front of you is a man, undefinable, any words you can think of sloughing off of your tongue as you forget who he his or who you are or why any of this is happening to you, right at this moment as you can't even remember walking into the building and- He snaps his fingers.
"Not another cretin... Snap out of it!" 
Your mind clears, still filled with that rotting haze, and even looking at the face directly causes another bout of dizziness that threatens to pour your mind out into a puddle on the pavement. Thoughts swim away as you force your head to turn away, flexing each muscle in concert to wrench the neck around until the old man no longer fills your field of vision. Finally, you can breathe again, parts of your chest you forgot existed choosing this moment to relax themselves, a trembling sigh emerging from your gaping maw whilst another disparaged one escaped from behind you.
"Let's begin."
Fighting the nausea flooding out of you proves too much, and you're unconscious while he drags your half-dead body away.

You wake up, in a room, with no concept of how much time has passed. Language fails you. You babble incoherently as a machine pumps your chest, breathing for you. Your eyes are pried open as a shapeless lump moves toward you. 
"Moron." 
The voice, distorted and yet clear as day, piercing into you and brings your awareness back into clarity. 
"Do you know why you're here?"
A babble sounds. It pains you to admit that it takes you a moment to realize the noise comes from your throat. You don't even consider the understanding that had returned, allowing you to process the voices.
"Figures. Your name doesn't matter, and neither does mine."
You had never even considered the fact you had a name. The very thought fills you with anguish. To have such a central part of your identity stripped away from you is the final piece cementing that you are **broken**. You have no idea if this is who you are, if you're even in the right body or the right form, if your thoughts and emotions are even yours or just a response to the hormones and anxiety and adrenaline running through your body, if anything was altered; you can't breathe, you can't even think without a concern that none of this is right filling your mind, without a painful inhale physically forcing itself upon you and consigning you to consider if, again, any of your actions are born of autonomy rather than biology.
It is a complete crisis of the self; ego-death and existentialism combined into a sordid patch of brain-melting gauze; he isn't even aware of it.
"All that you need to know is that this isn't new. You've been here before, have done what I asked, and this cycle will continue until the day you die, permanently, or become useless to me."
And as you thought it can't get worse... it does. Every concern is deleteriously unassuaged as you're confronted by the returning fact that not even your memory is inviolate, rather its stripped from you in a toxic manner that makes everything seem **broken**, bits and pieces refusing to slot together as you start trying to scream; you don't know how long you've been here, how many times this has happened, how many yous there have been, if your self is really yourself. if anything you do will matter of if you have a choice, if and if and if.  
The room's chill is getting to you, your skin cooling from the outside in, bone curling up in a sense as you breakdown, attempting to huddle inside yourself in a futile gesture, seeking sanctuary from a collapsed shelter that's sanctity was scorned by this stupid, indescribable lump of nothing with a face of cloth. The man ignores you, and continues talking. "Your" body refuses to move. 
"You are going to go into Sooth carrying a large, untraceable explosive embedded into your DNA. Let me be clear. Not the genetic code of a bomb, but the entirety of your body being rewritten to have the functional structure of an explosive whilst barely maintaining coherency. Upon your death, you are to be retrieved by Me or another version of Myself and reassembled for another task."
The lack of memories could almost be said to result directly from the presence of this Old Man. Even shielded from any influence, even being separated by cloth and metal and anything else, just being in his presence makes your mind unweave itself.
