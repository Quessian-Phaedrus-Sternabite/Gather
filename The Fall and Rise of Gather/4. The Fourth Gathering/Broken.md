Your head lies in shattered pieces, each memory a stab to the brain. In front of you is a Man, undefinable, any words you can think of sloughing off of your tongue as you forget who He is or who you are or why any of this is happening to you, right at this moment as you can't even remember walking into the building and- He snaps his fingers.

"Not another cretin... Snap out of it!" 

Your mind clears, still filled with that rotting haze, and even looking at the face directly causes another bout of dizziness that threatens to pour your mind out into a puddle on the pavement. Thoughts swim away as you force your head to turn away, flexing each muscle in concert to wrench the neck around until the old man no longer fills your field of vision. Finally, you can breathe again, parts of your chest you forgot existed choosing this moment to relax themselves, a trembling sigh emerging from your gaping maw whilst another disparaged one escaped from behind you.

"Let's begin."

Fighting the nausea flooding out of you proves too much, and you're unconscious while He drags your half-dead body away.

***

You wake up, in a room, with no concept of how much time has passed. Language fails you. You babble incoherently as a machine pumps your chest, breathing for you. Your eyes are pried open as a shapeless lump moves toward you. 

"Moron." 

The voice, distorted and yet clear as day, piercing into you and brings your awareness back into clarity. 

"Do you know why you're here?"

A babble sounds. It pains you to admit that it takes you a moment to realize the noise comes from your throat. You don't even consider the understanding that had returned, allowing you to process the voices.

"Figures. Your name doesn't matter, and neither does mine."

You had never even considered the fact you had a name. The very thought fills you with anguish. To have such a central part of your identity stripped away from you is the final piece cementing that you are **broken**. You have no idea if this is who you are, if you're even in the right body or the right form, if your thoughts and emotions are even yours or just a response to the hormones and anxiety and adrenaline running through your body, if anything was altered; you can't breathe, you can't even think without a concern that none of this is right filling your mind, without a painful inhale physically forcing itself upon you and consigning you to consider if, again, any of your actions are born of autonomy rather than biology.

It is a complete crisis of the self; ego-death and existentialism combined into a sordid patch of brain-melting gauze; He isn't even aware of it.

"All that you need to know is that this isn't new. You've been here before, have done what I asked, and this cycle will continue until the day you die, permanently, or become useless to me."

And as you thought it can't get worse... it does. Every concern is deleteriously unassuaged as you're confronted by the returning fact that not even your memory is inviolate, rather its stripped from you in a toxic manner that makes everything seem **broken**, bits and pieces refusing to slot together as you start trying to scream; you don't know how long you've been here, how many times this has happened, how many yous there have been, if your self is really yourself. if anything you do will matter of if you have a choice, if and if and if.  
The room's chill is getting to you, your skin cooling from the outside in, bone curling up in a sense as you breakdown, attempting to huddle inside yourself in a futile gesture, seeking sanctuary from a collapsed shelter that's sanctity was scorned by this stupid, indescribable lump of nothing with a face of cloth. The man ignores you, and continues talking. "Your" body refuses to move. 

"You are going to go into Sooth carrying a large, untraceable explosive embedded into your DNA. Let me be clear. Not the genetic code of a bomb, but the entirety of your body being rewritten to have the functional structure of an explosive whilst barely maintaining coherency. Upon your death, you are to be retrieved by Me or another version of Myself and reassembled for another task."

How it feels to find out that your genetic code has even been altered in an irreversible way, your DNA made to collapse and detonate in ways you don't understand but are surely going to be responsible for some death, your body merely a machine breaking down with every second, your cells and housekeepers replaced with *literal ticking time bombs*, even those not enough to stop this wretched abomination from resurrecting you for repetition, this eldritch being forcing your hand and refusing to allow you any free will. With a herculean effort, you begin tearing away at your chest, chunks of skin coming off in gobs as sobs wrack your addled mind. 

"*What* are you doing?"

The hallucination stops; your hands are by your side and your chest thrashes while you make more of those incoherent noises. It must be tiring, being that stupid. 

"Behave yourself. Or don't, I don't really care. Unfortunately, there aren't any asylums on Sooth, or that's where I'd send you, but you can pretend to be mute for the time being. Now then! Come with me and we'll get you ready."

Without even a word of protest, your face locks up and your body walks itself behind him.

A tattered husk files into the room at a safe distance, and you can only watch from behind a clouded glass as your field of vision coalesces on the mirror in front of you. No familiarity lurks behind those empty eyes. The man is seemingly vanished, but you're aware that He can't be far. Sure enough, the disgusting, disgusted voice calls out from everywhere:

"Put on the suit."

The "suit" in question is a shapeless, shifting form of pearlescent fabric, in colors you didn't even know existed; it was odd, in a way, to be confronted with something that defies only hour-old expectations. It slides on of its own volition, or it could just be you thrashing rhythmically in response to the Old Man's words. In front of you, in the mirror, the face looking back at you is pensive, morose, melancholic. It is a person devoid of recognition, your own body being alien to you; nothing fits together like you'd expect, none of the joints seem to move right no matter how much you flex, none of the colors or shapes or even forms align with your notions of self based on your mind. You don't even know if this is what you were born as. Are you just a mind? Thrown callously into whatever shape would hold you? Are you even alive, or just a machine to match the clockwork of the grenade you inhabit.

For once in your short encounter, the man seems content to let you ref-

"Finish putting it on! You need to *blend in*. Everything else is ready, except for you."

Right. You grasp at the other accessories on the floor and load your corpse of a sheath up; the pull of his presence changing to another room in this confinement. Out you emerge into a glorious vista of... nothing.

It is beautiful. The universe your oyster, you stare out into the scintillating void and gaze in awe and wonder, staring at the stars, the moons, and even the planet before you; it stands there, seemingly alone against the inky canvas, a peaceful beast slumbering beneath its blankets of metal and people, infinities and pinpricks of light stabbing into your eyes with a calming presence. And you're going there. It's more of a daze this time; He doesn't even have to force you to step inside of another, smaller room--its window is all the motivation you need. You're treated to another magnificent sight as the very air around you burns, filling both the pod and your soul with unrealistic warmth. You begin to drift down, slowly but surely.

***

When you land, a procession receives you kindly. They seem to understand your condition, and as you babble, concerned, about the Man and his treatment of you, warm nods cross their faces. They can't listen. Language fails you, emotions fail you, thoughts fail you; nothing works. He ruined you. You are **broken**, your body moving independently as your brain seems to guide it through all the necessary motions of greetings, bows and gestures and even smiles flowing away from you. What's the point? Of you being there, of this mold being filled with your porous "intelligence," of you being silenced in favor of muscle memory. 

None of the dignitaries notice your dilemma, and instead choose to maneuver you through the chamber, a glorious masterpiece of architecture and columns, so many columns stretching in every direction in an Escherian love letter, gold and tungsten and platinum and bronze inlays filling every surface. It is the most beautiful building you've ever seen; it is the only building you've ever seen; you can't even comprehend something greater. And to think: this is only the walkway into wherever you're going. 

For the first time, a true smile lays itself upon your face.

The hallway opens up some ten or twelve hours later, and just when your legs seem to be giving out, you enter into a clear plaza. Directly overhead is a star, shining effervescently with an austere light, perfectly enough to illuminate the man in front of you.

"Rise." He commands. You do so, not even having realized you were plastered to the floor in his sight; your body feels back in your command. "Aevum Caern Desolate Plains of / Birch's Infinite Decades / Relinquish Concern, bear witness to His Honor Aevum Lace the Silent Wake of the Law, Current and Perpetual Head of the Supreme Court of Gather, Delegate of the-"

A thrum cuts him off. You can see his eyes widen, and feel your own do the same, before several hundred kilometers vaporize as the explosives you're made of go off and level the plaza. 

You're not a rule-breaker; you understand that your body is gone, eviscerated with everything else in the area. But all the same, you *see*. In "front" of you, a crater lies down, stretching several hundred kilometers in diameter, sending out a shockingly non-nuclear blast wave out in it's wake. And then, before your trembling awareness, it begins to crawl backwards.

None of this makes sense, you think, and your heart seems to crawl to a halt as the shockwave reaches you and a tugging pulls on your discombobulated presence. The cold hand of death jerks you back, and you watch as the dust clusters in front of you, reforming in the shape of a singular man amongst the sound of millions of corpses *thudding* to the ground as the body is reformed, but not in time to preserve consciousness.

"You do not understand." The man nearly whispers in a tone not befitting someone of his towering gait; it alarms you to no avail as he seems to stare at where you preside. "I am order." Some of the bodies stir, those who constructed their lifeline with enough care to prevent disembodiment. The majority do not. And before you can say anything, babbles or otherwise, you feel a claw thrust you across the light-years and into another cold shell.

Your head lies in shattered pieces, each memory a stab to the brain. In front of you is a Man, indescribable except for one word... **smug**.
