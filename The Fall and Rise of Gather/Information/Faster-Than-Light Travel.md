# The Kuiper Drive
Named after the famed scientist, the Kuiper Drive was the first prototype made by humanity that allowed for travel to other star systems. A classic wave, or bubble drive, it operated via compression and extension of space, providing a distorted zone in which one was "technically" moving slower than light relative to the zone but not the wider universe. It required merely the presence of extraordinarily dense material and large fuel reserves of hydrogen pellets.

Humanity did it. They used nukes. For space. This is absurdly destructive, expensive, and toxic to anything.
