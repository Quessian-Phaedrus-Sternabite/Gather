## The Main 7
Throughout the entirety of Gather, there are 7 main crèches, each stemming from one of the original members. Personalities range wildly within crèches, but certain physical characteristics remain prominent in earlier eras.

### Aevum
Named after [Charles Aevum](0.%20Overview%201.md#^f75ec3). Aevum was a Supreme Court Justice who eventually joined the UN, and later served as a legal and ethical guide for Gather. Focused primarily with the importance of the law and justice, Aevum puts great emphasis on morality above all else. It's citizens can be described as "strained," with the average Aevuternite being forced to conform to rigid laws throughout the reaches of the Empire. As a result, when Gather began to fall, the Aevuternites were the first to turn to lawlessness. 

### Cathan
Cathan's founder [Noelle Cathan](0.%20Overview%201.md#^251a3e), a great descendent of Saint Cathan, was selected for Gather due to her peaceful stance on reality. She, of course, used this inner calm to attain massive wealth through stock trading, and her shipping business, Cathan Goods, was one of the most powerful pre-Gather corporations. In the second Gathering, the genetically engineered armies of Goods proved an effective force to contend with any of the other Crèches, despite lacking in conventional warfare technologies. Cathan banks were known for their reliability during the golden era of Gather ([[In the Vaults of Monotony]]), and Cathan Goods was a reliable source of economical growth during the time. 

## Veritas
Josiah Veritas was widely considered the most ambitious man of the Space Age. Headed science committee 

## Fidelis
Fidelis stems from faith. Perhaps government? Most Crèches find them agreeable. Average people, extreme variety

## Novus
The most ambitious. Known for [Orion Drives](Faster-Than-Light Travel#^bf48a8). Constantly destroying planets, achieved the first Human-made megastructure ([[Project Requisition Form Epsilon Eridani 102]])
## Tempi

## Lucis
