## Era-Wise Conventions
Any titles go in front of the first name or the entire name.
- 1st Gathering - First name, Last name. *Daniel Lewis* ^0b885e
	- First name used as a shortened form. *Daniel*
- 2nd Gathering - Crèche, First name, Last name. *Aevum Daniel Lewis*
	- First name within Crèche, Crèche and First name outside. *Daniel*, *Aevum Daniel*
- 3rd Gathering - Crèche, Significant number, First name. *Aevum 12 Daniel*
	- Significant numbers serve as a potential familial name. First adopted during the plague, as families became looser and people sought to make their name part of their own identity
	- As Crèches begin dissolving during the Putrescence, they hold less impact, due to unification beginning.
	- Formal introduction. *Aevum 12 Daniel*. Casual conversation. *12 Daniel*. Friends. *Daniel*
- 4th Gathering - Crèche, Family, Name including titles or phrases. *Aevum Lewis Daniel of the Undying Clouds. ^876a4e
	- By far the longest, due to the golden age being needlessly complicated. Since names include the name plus a phrase, as [[Conceptual Space]] becomes prevalent, most don't share their full name freely. Significant numbers fall off as population grows
	- Formal introduction. *Aevum Lewis Daniel*.  Societal. *Lewis Daniel*. Casual conversation. *Daniel.* Friends. *Daniel*.
	- The shorter the name, the older the person generally is, as many people rushed to take short phrasal names.
- 5th Gathering - Crèche, Family, Name, Iteration ^47bfe4
	- Due to [Cloning](0.%20Overview%205#%5E639685.md), an iteration number is optional. 
	- Formal. *Aevum Lewis Daniel 2*. Societal. *Lewis Daniel 2*. Casual. *Daniel 2*
- 6th Gathering - Crèche, Family, Name
	- Iterations are only occasionally visible
- 7th Gathering - Crèche (on occasion), name
	- Very basic.

## Crèche Conventions
### General
- Aevum - Welsh or Mediterranean in origin. 
- Cathan - Irish, or just generally western European in origin
- Novus - Stemming from middle-eastern roots. As such, instead of last or family names, the names of a father (or mother if needed) is used. Umbra was born in Greece, but raised in turkey, and she chose to embrace their naming system for her vassals.
- Fidelis - Australian!
- Tempi

### Fourth Gathering
- Aevum - Aevum instill a phrasal name onto a child from birth, usually representing a poem.
- Fidelis - Fidelis tend to choose it as part of becoming an adult, and as such, many are the bearer's favorite thing.
- Cathan - The Phrasal name represents the casting off of childhood.
