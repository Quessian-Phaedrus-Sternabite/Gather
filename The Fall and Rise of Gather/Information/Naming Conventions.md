## Era-Wise Conventions
Any titles go in front of the first name or the entire name.
- 1st Gathering - First name, Last name. *Daniel Lewis* ^0b885e
	- First name used as a shortened form. *Daniel*
- 2nd Gathering - Crèche, First name, Last name. *Aevum Daniel Lewis*
	- First name within Crèche, Crèche and First name outside. *Daniel*, *Aevum Daniel*
- 3rd Gathering - Crèche, Significant number, First name. *Aevum 12 Daniel*
	- Significant numbers serve as a potential familial name. First adopted during the plague, as families became looser and people sought to make their name part of their own identity
	- As Crèches begin dissolving during the Corruption, they hold less impact, due to unification beginning.
	- Formal introduction. *Aevum 12 Daniel*. Casual conversation. *12 Daniel*. Friends. *Daniel*
- 4th Gathering - Crèche, Family, Name including titles or phrases. *Aevum Lewis Daniel of the Undying Clouds. ^876a4e
	- By far the longest, due to the golden age being needlessly complicated. Since names include the name plus a phrase, as [[Conceptual Space]] becomes prevalent, most don't share their full name freely. Significant numbers fall off as population grows
	- Formal introduction. *Aevum Lewis Daniel*.  Societal. *Lewis Daniel*. Casual conversation. *Daniel*. Friends. *Daniel*.
- 5th Gathering - Crèche, Family, Name, Iteration ^47bfe4
	- Due to [Cloning](0.%20Overview%205#%5E639685.md), an iteration number is optional. 
	- Formal. *Aevum Lewis Daniel 2*. Societal. *Lewis Daniel 2*. Casual. *Daniel 2*
- 6th Gathering - Crèche, Family, Name
	- Iterations are only occasionally visible
