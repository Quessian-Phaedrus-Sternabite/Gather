You remember standing there, on the bow of a grand carrier, observing the war that took place. Dimly, in your head, you wondered if it could have been avoided. Before that thought could take root though, you shook it out. You weren't paid to think, only to act. And act you shall.  As the viewport seems to crest the corona of the system's sun, you steel yourself in your righteousness. Cathan Goods, above all else, must be protected. Comfort reigns supreme, a casual ease of mind that comes with practice, honed since birth. Your mind is alight with the sheer expanse of possibilities offered to you, and you sort through them without a care in the world. Well, with one care. Deep inside your eye of minds lurks an image of a pond. You don't know where it is, or even where you saw it, but there lies an utter certainty, an utter weight of importance instilled within the pond. Whilst your compatriots and you fight, exposed to the elements to feel every bite of your environment, you occasionally steel yourself with glances towards that inner pond, calming your mind. For this reason, you idly quirb[^1], you've stayed alive longer than almost anyone you know.
A siren pulls you out of your contemplative bliss as the ship begins entering the orbit of the battlefield, a moon, strangely devoid of craters. Someone wiser than you might make a connection between the lack of an asteroid belt with this, but you can't focus on that right now. It seems, after all, in this advanced age, the only thoughts that run through your mind anymore are that of combat and that of the pond. You try and remember again what the pond is, and why it's so important to you, but a voice from all around halts you in the track.
"Listen up!" the voice intones, dull yet filled with depths of meaning, importing feelings of rushing and urgency. Semantic processing technology allows for a complex series of neurotransmitters and brain tissue to be rapidly stimulated, allowing for nuanced communication without intense language. Despite saving hundreds of lives daily with the dirges of context provided, it is often ignored, or chalked up as 'empathy' to those who benefit the most from it. You, of course, are no different. "We land in less than 5 minutes!" The general doesn't need to raise her voice, the processing takes care of any loudness. It still hurts your ears, though, with the volume, despite there being no difference from normal squabble. Within your skull lies several dozen plates, designed for anything from a display thrown down your optic nerve to bone conduction for sound processing. The Cathan mindset is [[Superiority through Purity]], and since the very first shipments went out through Cathan Goods, the prime benefits of humanity were embraced. In your case, you prepare to fall from the brazen skies above Losh and engage in warfare until your very bones give out. The same content emotion fills you, and you feel your strength seemingly redoubled before the prospect of engaging with filthy Veritas troops with your pure forces. You are positive, would bet anything on it in fact, that your brothers-and-sisters-in-arms would agree with you, and the room seems abuzz with ambition. Ambition, that oh-so-powerful emotion that's driven you to the heights you stand at today. You know that one of the paragons of ambition, [Noelle Cathan](Overview%201#^251a3e) herself stands at the top of a peak in the center of the battlefield, commanding her troops through serene tranquility. She's a direct pacifist, wouldn't hurt a fly herself, but when it came to orders... They're all just numbers on screens, aren't they? The Calamity drove a wedge between her and Veritas. Despite their entanglement, here you were, fighting against soldiers equally devoted to Veritas. Those idiots. You're always told you're just a pawn, but when you're sitting there, looking at your pond, you question, "Does it matter?" The th
