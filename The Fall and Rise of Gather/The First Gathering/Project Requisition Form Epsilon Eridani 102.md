#story , #novus, #one
1.My fellow council members. I, Umbra Novus, founding member of Gather, formally request a 2. grant from the finance committee, overseen by Noelle Cathan, the legal committee, overseen by 3.Charles Aevum, and the ethical committee, overseen by Amy Fidelis, to construct the first of Humanity's megastructures around the star Epsilon Eridani, a Dyson sphere to supply power to any Gather associated bodies.
