## Description
The beginning of Gather came about when the Founder recruited 7 of the world's most ambitious thinkers in an effort to bring about societal reform. After about 20 years of extraordinary success, the Founder was murdered by one of the group, leading to an immense conflict between the remaining 7.

## Writing Guide
When writing for the first gathering, it should generally be positive. Ideally, this is an organization of the greatest minds known to humanity. However, there should be a dark undertone throughout, showing how characters are stained by their ambitions.

## Notable Characters
- **The Founder** - By far the most notable yet enigmatic character, the founder is the one who started Gather. Ambiguity should be present in all early mentions, as the point is to embellish the mythos of the founder.
- **Charles Aevum** - Led the legal committee of Gather. ^f75ec3
- **Noelle Cathan** - Noelle was a monk of the courts of Roth on her homeworld of Rhyne[^1]. Emphasis on the was, as she decided to leave and start her empire of profit the second she turned 18. Cathan Goods became a prominent company, with the 2nd Gathering cementing them as vital to all of humanity ([[Transportation Requested]]). Cathan began focusing on biological perfection, but ultimately failed to make significant changes. Due to being in command of a large chunk of the universe, the power eventually got to her, and in a grand act of self-destruction seldom seen before or since, Noelle managed to take out an entire solar system during a fight with Veritas Forces ([[Shipped into Oblivion]]). Despite the grand blow to the company, Cathan Goods persevered, offering its services as vaults of Gather, using the immense wealth and security granted to it by the Founder to produce an economy of trade unrivaled in the universe, though certainly not due to a lack of trying. After the destruction of the 3rd Gathering, many vaults were lost to time, with their existences becoming that of legend, sought out by many a treasure hunter. In the gilded age, the banks were renewed in their vigor, and continued to be grand works ([[In the Vaults of Monotony]]). Unfortunately, this made them a prime target for robbery ([[Champions of Nothing]])  ^251a3e

## Naming Conventions
Era-wise, this would occur near the beginning of human space exploration. As a result, names are standard with current practices.[^2]
[^1]: As it was a small colony world on the outskirts of human space, the meaning of the "ditch" applied literally to most.
