Most legends are assumed to be told during the 6th or 7th Gathering, as they represent the Dark Ages of Gather, and would be a time when the average citizen had little access to Aevum regulated history (in part due to Aevum's decline). They should be embellished, and are not entirely accurate, though can be retold with canonical accuracy.
