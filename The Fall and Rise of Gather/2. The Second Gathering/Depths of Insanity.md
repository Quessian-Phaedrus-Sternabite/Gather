%% *This is the story of a man named Stanley. Dune, but snow. Based off Dante's Divine Comedy.* %%
%% Draft - Bad
This is the story of a man named Stanley. He stood silently, staring down into a pit that wrapped around the tundra until its edges faded from view, obscured by the falling snow. Beneath him, permafrost gives way to ice gives way to air as the platform he's standing on trembles with an oncoming train. It's nothing more than a ledge at the top of the enclave, peering out over the sprawling labyrinth nestled in the pit.
Inferno. At its center--a forge. Anything and everything goes in; be it fuel, smelting material, or even garbage that can't be bothered with anymore. The flames stretch up for hundreds of meters, giving off heat that melted the ice and made the funnel all those years ago. The wasteland surrounding the city hover somewhere around -20 Celsius on a warm day. It was death in a pile of snow.%%

This is the story of a man named Stanley. He sat on a chair in the middle of the street, ignoring the protests of all those walking around him. The pedestrians parting like a sea around his stony chair, and he took a long drag on his reed as he continued to rock. Nobody dared to come close, despite his obvious protrusion. Except, of course, for one woman.

She stood at only 150 cm, a paltry sum compared even to Stanley's chair, which was almost 2 meters tall even before rocking. His legs still met the ground evenly. The woman walked up to Stanley with a peculiar gait and a smile in her eyes. Warmth bled off of her, dripping into the frost of the street. Stanley made eye contact with the woman, and grinned softly.

"Excuse me, Sir," she began, nary a waver in her tone as she looked up at Stanley. "My name is Evelyn Lou, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to request that you move." Seeing no frown appear on his face, she continued, growing in confidence: "It's nothing personal, really, it just so happens that there are a few carts I passed on my way here, and I fear they won't be able to pass if you remain in the way." Wind blew through the crowd, suddenly frozen as everyone stared at the couple. The silence was broken by somebody hurling trash off the ledge the pair faced.

Stanley's chair stopped rocking. Below, a distant *thud* was heard as the bag impacted some poor, unfortunate soul. Stanley continued to smile, and unfolded himself from the chair. He towered over Evelyn, over the street even, and he stopped over with an unmistakable bend dragging apart his back. His shirt stretched uncomfortably, and his arms extended out, seemingly impossibly thin. The smile never stopped, teeth unfurling themselves in a wicked gleam as Stanley stretched his mouth wider and wider, going until his lips cracked and blood dripped down.

"Just what," he asked, "do you think you're doing getting in the way of my relaxation?" Despite the calm, almost casual tone of the question, it sent a chill into Evelyn's heart.

"Well, you see, I just don't think it's fair that one person can monopolize the road. I understand if you want to watch the snow, but surely you can do that without inconveniencing others, no?" There was a slight tremor as she spoke, but Evelyn drew herself up and smiled again, radiating heat.

"Shame." Stanley said, and in a flash of movement he swept his leg into the woman's face, throwing Evelyn several meters forward and hundreds down. A crunch follows, waiting as long as possible to stir the fellow crowd members. A soft cracking can be heard from the bare skin and sweat on Stanley's leg freezing in the cold. He reaches down and plucks away the flesh, throwing it off the edge as well, following Evelyn to a certain doom. The muscle underneath steams, but it's quickly wrapped up by one of the myriad of cloths shrouding Stanley.
