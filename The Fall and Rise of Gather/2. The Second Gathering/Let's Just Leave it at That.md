I slid into the corridor on my back, brushing my pants' leg against the edge as I did so. Another thing to make note of, I suppose, as the edge isn't smooth in the slightest. The rest of the pod tells the same story, with nails sticking out and scraping at my sides the further into the pod I go. I can tell I've reached the back when a hollow thud rings out from my head, the pillow absent from its normal resting spot; a whisper of a curse escapes my mouth as I try not to yell. 
Everything is silent, soundproofing used to its full effect, but I still don't want to be loud. It feels sacred, like the cramped closet on its side is my own sanctuary, peaceful and free of the din of life. The tube is falling apart, but at least it's quiet. I hesitate for a moment more before prodding the mattress under me with a clipboard, feeling for any lumps. It's impossible to know what customers will leave behind, and the less often we have to run down to the wash, the better. As far as I can tell, there's nothing spilt on the fabric, the only issue being the horrible smell left behind.
It smells like death, or at least a lot of body odor, and it's only gotten worse the further back in the bed I've gone. I pull up the pillow and hold my nose as a dirty set of clothing slides off underneath, the shuffling of cloth enough to make me queasy in the low light. I pull out a bit of *senescence* from my pocket; it wraps securely around my face and embraces me in a scent "so good I can taste it!" Still, it barely covers the smell of the clothes. 
Gloves go on, and I toe the button to open the door, wincing as the harsh light returns. You never notice something is missing until it returns, I suppose. Nobody says a word to me as I shuffle out, and I grab a bag from the cart outside to dump the outfit in. It's ragged, a jumpsuit with more holes than threads, and I briefly consider just burning it to be done with the matter. Shaking my head, I throw a bar of soap in the pod and flick on the wash switch, nodding briefly as the telltale hum starts up. Not a sound of water is heard as I walk towards the front desk.

"So anyways, he turns to me, and, you'll never believe it, tries to--" 
"Oh come on, stop teasing the new guy!" Marg throws a light punch at Bill's arm as he gestures wildly, and the two of them start laughing while I sit in silence. A few seconds go by before their laughs fade, Bill looking back towards me with a warm expression.
"You alright?" He asks, noticing my silence. "You realize I was joking, right? They banned popcorn 12 years ago for that very reason.  "
