To say he was outraged would be an understatement. In front of [Josiah](Notable%20Characters.md#^2faa7e) laid a human male, of an astounding 7'3" height. It seemed to be stripped of any personality whatsoever, the very organs being laid out as if someone tried to reconstruct a human from a standardized textbook. Those at Cathan had taken it too far, bastardizing genetics themselves in an attempt to create a "pure" soldier to defend their shipping. Veritas was different. He cared, deeply, for everyone working for him. Trillions had gone solely into research, development, and production of the armor and weapons needed to ensure survival in this cold, cold universe. Gather was supposed to be better than this. Ever since that fateful day, Josiah was always striving, reaching out to grasp the sun. But much like Daedalus, he had pushed beyond his boundaries. The very technologies used to establish superiority had made Gather a target. And now... It was all Veritas could do to defend his workers, nay, his family against the harsh embraces of the other 6 members of Gather. But in his territory, Veritas was king, ruler of all. Every micron of every laboratory he had established was dutifully monitored and observed, if not by him than by one of the hundreds of thousands of employees he maintained across his little pocket of the universe.
