To say he was outraged would be an understatement. In front of [Josiah](Notable%20Characters.md#^2faa7e) laid a human male, of an astounding 7'3" height. It seemed to be stripped of any personality whatsoever, the very organs being laid out as if someone tried to reconstruct a human from a standardized textbook. Those at Cathan had taken it too far, bastardizing genetics themselves in an attempt to create a "pure" soldier to defend their shipping. Veritas was different. He cared, deeply, for everyone working for him. Trillions had gone solely into research, development, and production of the armor and weapons needed to ensure survival in this cold, cold universe. Gather was supposed to be better than this. Ever since that fateful day, Josiah was always striving, reaching out to grasp the sun. But much like Daedalus, he had pushed beyond his boundaries. The very technologies used to establish superiority had made Gather a target. And now... It was all Veritas could do to defend his workers, nay, his family against the harsh embraces of the other 6 members of Gather. But in his territory, Veritas was king, ruler of all. Every micron of every laboratory he had established was dutifully monitored and observed, if not by him than by one of the hundreds of thousands of employees he maintained across his little pocket of the universe. It was complete control. And it was his.

At first glance, the brain seemed to be nothing but tumors, every part of the man's flesh seeming fetid upon inspection. He dug deeper, and he watched as the brain seemed to unfold; the tumors were revealed to be bruises and lesions from implanted wetware that struggled to grow through the head. It seemed as if a computer was directly wired into the optical nerve, brainstem, and who knows what else. The fibrous mass was fully integrated, and even connected to bone conduction plates for audio. An entire communications system, implanted in a brain from birth. It was sickening. None of these soldiers were given a choice, just constant conditioning and surgeries until they became the perfect weapon.
In that regard, Cathan had succeeded. Despite their disagreements, and her crimes against humanity, Josiah had to give her respect in that regards. The skin of the man was thick, almost scaley in it's origin, and a sickly ashen-grey
