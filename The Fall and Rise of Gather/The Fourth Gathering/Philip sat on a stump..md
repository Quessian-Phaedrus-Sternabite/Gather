The first amongst his family, Novus Farche The Wind Propelling the Strings of Various Phillips - known as Phillip to his friends and Novus Phillips to those his family would rather he not associate with - decided against pursuing the business of engineering, for within his life he found a more pure pursuit of theoretical mathematics; to him, it felt as if he could visualize the tapestry of the world whilst holding a bottle of dye, unable to affect it precisely, but if he tried with all of his capability, he could make a splash of color: unfortunately, this colorful attitude serviced him only with disappointment as time and time again he was rejected from jobs due to heritage, as was custom in the earlier days of the Fourth Gathering; after the latest in a job rejection, and the harshest of disappointments thus far, Phillips sat on a stump in quiet solitude and overlooked the city of his birth, Umval, home to a population demographic consisting of a relatively solid and remarkably consistent mixtures of the various Cr√®chelings, before debating on his life's pursuit, another newfangled custom since conceptual space was discovered; it involved devoting one's life to focus entirely on a single intense action, movement, or philosophy; Phillips' parents had decided 'gainst it, choosing instead to multitask and focus on the lesser part of conceptuality by merely making a name for themselves, but for Phillips, recognition wasn't enough: he had to be more, to seek more, to *do* something more with his life than be a faceless engineer in a society where less and less traditionalists persisted (granted, of course, this made engineers more valuable, despite the clashing cultures arising from the vast spread of civilizations, forcing companies and individuals to increasingly deal with and navigate around the needs of many), so instead, as he sat on the stump, he contemplated the very idea of abstart mathematics, and what it meant to fully engross oneself in an idea; oddly enough, he became engrossed in the idea of engrossment, as many before him as done, and he stopped moving from the stump entirely- in the days of pilgramage that many youths with newfound immortality abused to their fullest
