#information, #conceptual 
Conceptual Space is a key component of the 4th Gathering, and is part of what cemented is as the Golden Age of Gather. By tapping into an outside realm and binding it to the identity of "Gather," ([[Screams]]) a potent tool was created that utilized public reception to fuel reality. As such, key figures were capable of amazing feats through sheer power of will[^1].
